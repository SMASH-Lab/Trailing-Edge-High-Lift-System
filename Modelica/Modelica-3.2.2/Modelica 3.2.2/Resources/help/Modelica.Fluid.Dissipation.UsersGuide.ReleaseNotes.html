<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<h4>Version 1.0 Beta 4-6, 2010-01-12</h4>
<p>Fluid.Dissipation was improved for the release as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed structure for input records of all heat transfer and
pressure loss functions:
<ul>
<li>Reduced amount of input records for compressible and
incompressible functions as well as for their combinational one to
improve usability of library.</li>
<li>Splitting input records of one function into one with
parameters (e.g., for geometry) and one with variables (e.g., fluid
properties) to ease work of IDE-solver.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved Modelica.Fluid application models for available heat
transfer and pressure loss functions:
<ul>
<li>Flattened inheritance with one base flow model for all energy
devices.</li>
<li>Implemented smooth state of fluid density and dynamic viscosity
for reverse flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adaption of complete library due to structure change.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.0 Beta 3, 2009-07-03</h4>
<p>Fluid.Dissipation was improved for the release as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed flow models structure:<br />
Now that a future feature for the automatic choice of using either
a mass flow rate (compressible case) or a pressure loss
(incompressible case) function for calculation is supported if
implemented by IDE. Due to that no manual selection of a
compressible or incompressible calculation in the Modelica.Fluid
flow models is possible anymore. Therefore nonlinear equations will
be created from the Modelica.Fluid flow models, if the future
feature is not supported and the mass flow rate is known at a fluid
port instead of the pressure loss.</li>
<li>Changed structure and amount of records used as input for
function calls due to changed structure of flow model.</li>
<li>Changed structure of function calls due to changed structure of
flow model.</li>
<li>Finished validation of all available heat transfer and pressure
loss functions.</li>
<li>Included scripts for verification of all available heat
transfer and pressure loss functions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.0 Beta 2, 2009-04-22</h4>
<p>Fluid.Dissipation was improved for the release as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support of analytical Jacobians at inverse calculation of heat
transfer and pressure loss functions.</li>
<li>Included Modelica.Fluid application models for available heat
transfer and pressure loss functions.</li>
<li>Adaption of complete library to Modelica Standard
nomenclature.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.0 Beta 1, 2008-10-08</h4>
Initial release of Fluid.Dissipation.
