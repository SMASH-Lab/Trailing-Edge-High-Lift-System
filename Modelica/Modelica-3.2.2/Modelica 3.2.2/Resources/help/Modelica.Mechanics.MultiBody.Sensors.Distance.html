<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>The <b>distance</b> between the origins of frame_a and of
frame_b are determined and provided at the output signal connector
<b>distance</b>. This distance is always positive.
<b>Derivatives</b> of this signal can be easily obtained by
connecting the block <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.Der.html">Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.Der</a>
to "distance" (this block performs analytic differentiation of the
input signal using the der(..) operator).</p>
<p>In the following figure the animation of a Distance sensor is
shown. The light blue coordinate system is frame_a, the dark blue
coordinate system is frame_b, and the yellow arrow is the animated
sensor.</p>

<p>If the distance is smaller as parameter <b>s_small</b> (in the
"advanced" menu), it is approximated such that its derivative is
finite for zero distance. Without such an approximation, the
derivative would be infinite and a division by zero would occur.
The approximation is performed in the following way: If distance
&gt; s_small, it is computed as sqrt(r*r) where r is the position
vector from the origin of frame_a to the origin of frame_b. If the
distance becomes smaller as s_small, the "sqrt()" function is
approximated by a second order polynomial, such that the function
value and its first derivative are identical for sqrt() and the
polynomial at s_small. Furthermore, the polynomial passes through
zero. The effect is, that the distance function is continuous and
differentiable everywhere. The derivative at zero distance is
3/(2*s_small).</p>
