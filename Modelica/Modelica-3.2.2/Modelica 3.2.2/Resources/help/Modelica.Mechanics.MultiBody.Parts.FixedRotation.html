<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Component for a <b>fixed translation</b> and <b>fixed
rotation</b> of frame_b with respect to frame_a, i.e., the
relationship between connectors frame_a and frame_b remains
constant. There are several possibilities to define the orientation
of frame_b with respect to frame_a:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Planar rotation</b> along axis 'n' (that is fixed and
resolved in frame_a) with a fixed angle 'angle'.</li>
<li><b>Vectors n_x</b> and <b>n_y</b> that are directed along the
corresponding axes direction of frame_b and are resolved in frame_a
(if n_y is not orthogonal to n_x, the y-axis of frame_b is selected
such that it is orthogonal to n_x and in the plane of n_x and
n_y).</li>
<li><b>Sequence</b> of <b>three planar axes rotations</b>. For
example, "sequence = {1,2,3}" and "angles = {90, 45, -90}" means to
rotate frame_a around the x axis with 90 degrees, around the new y
axis with 45 degrees and around the new z axis around -90 degrees
to arrive at frame_b. Note, that sequence={1,2,3} is the Cardan
angle sequence and sequence = {3,1,3} is the Euler angle
sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, this component is visualized by a cylinder
connecting frame_a and frame_b, as shown in the figure below. In
this figure frame_b is rotated along the z-axis of frame_a with 60
degree. Note, that the two visualized frames are not part of the
component animation and that the animation may be switched off via
parameter animation = <b>false</b>.</p>

<p><b>Release Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>July 28, 2003</i><br />
Bug fixed: if rotationType = PlanarRotationSequence, then 'angles'
was used with unit [rad] instead of [deg].</li>
</ul>
