<h4>Planned changes for version 3.1</h4>
<p>Several changes are planned for version 3.1 of Modelica.Media.
In order to have an easy transition, the current version is moved
to the ObsoleteModelica-package and current users can continue to
use it for many years. The goal for the new version is to cover
many more fluids, be easier to use for users and less for
implementers that want to include their own models. A beta-version
of the new media library will be available in the first quarter of
2009.</p>
<p>The main user-visible changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>No distinction between pure fluids and mixtures on the
interface level: pure fluids are mixtures with 1 component</li>
<li>Compressibility will in the future be a flag that can be set
for those media where it makes sense. It will thus be possible to
treat an ideal gas as incompressible, which is adequate for certain
applications, and also use the same medium model for thermal-only
applications, and thermal-hydraulic ones.</li>
<li>All functions will have derivatives to enable analytic
Jacobians.</li>
<li>Mole-fraction based media for process applications</li>
</ul>
<p>For further information on the upcoming version, please contact
the <a href="Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.Contact.html">Author</a></p>
<h4>Forward compatibility</h4>
<p>In order to simplify transition to the upcoming version of
Modelica.Media for Modelica 3.1, a new enumeration has been
introduced: <a href="Modelica.Media.Interfaces.Choices.IndependentVariables.html">
IndependentVariables</a> with the entries ph, pT, pTX, phX and dTX.
Users are advised to use this enumeration to determine the
independent variables of a medium. If they are going to use the
function based interface of the current Modelica.Media (and not use
the BaseProperties from Modelica.Media), they should not have any
trouble using the next version without any need for changes in
their code.</p>
