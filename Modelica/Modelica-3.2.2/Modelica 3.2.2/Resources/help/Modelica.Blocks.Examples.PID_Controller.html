<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This is a simple drive train controlled by a PID controller:</p>
<ul>
<li>The two blocks "kinematic_PTP" and "integrator" are used to
generate the reference speed (= constant acceleration phase,
constant speed phase, constant deceleration phase until inertia is
at rest). To check whether the system starts in steady state, the
reference speed is zero until time = 0.5 s and then follows the
sketched trajectory.</li>
<li>The block "PI" is an instance of "Blocks.Continuous.LimPID"
which is a PID controller where several practical important
aspects, such as anti-windup-compensation has been added. In this
case, the control block is used as PI controller.</li>
<li>The output of the controller is a torque that drives a motor
inertia "inertia1". Via a compliant spring/damper component, the
load inertia "inertia2" is attached. A constant external torque of
10 Nm is acting on the load inertia.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PI controller settings included "limitAtInit=false", in
order that the controller output limits of 12 Nm are removed from
the initialization problem.</p>
<p>The PI controller is initialized in steady state
(initType=SteadyState) and the drive shall also be initialized in
steady state. However, it is not possible to initialize "inertia1"
in SteadyState, because "der(inertia1.phi)=inertia1.w=0" is an
input to the PI controller that defines that the derivative of the
integrator state is zero (= the same condition that was already
defined by option SteadyState of the PI controller). Furthermore,
one initial condition is missing, because the absolute position of
inertia1 or inertia2 is not defined. The solution shown in this
examples is to initialize the angle and the angular acceleration of
"inertia1".</p>
<p>In the following figure, results of a typical simulation are
shown:</p>

<p>In the upper figure the reference speed (= integrator.y) and the
actual speed (= inertia1.w) are shown. As can be seen, the system
initializes in steady state, since no transients are present. The
inertia follows the reference speed quite good until the end of the
constant speed phase. Then there is a deviation. In the lower
figure the reason can be seen: The output of the controller (PI.y)
is in its limits. The anti-windup compensation works reasonably,
since the input to the limiter (PI.limiter.u) is forced back to its
limit after a transient phase.</p>
