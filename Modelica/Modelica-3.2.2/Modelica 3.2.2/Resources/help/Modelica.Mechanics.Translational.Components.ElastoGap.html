<p>This component models a spring damper combination that can lift
off. It can be connected between a sliding mass and the housing
(model <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Components.Fixed.html">Fixed</a>),
to describe the contact of a sliding mass with the housing.</p>
<p>As long as s_rel &gt; s_rel0, no force is exerted (s_rel =
flange_b.s - flange_a.s). If s_rel ≤ s_rel0, the contact force is
basically computed with a linear spring/damper characteristic. With
parameter n≥1 (exponent of spring force), a nonlinear spring force
can be modeled:</p>
<pre>
   desiredContactForce = c*|s_rel - s_rel0|^n + d*<b>der</b>(s_rel)
</pre>
<p>Note, Hertzian contact is described by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact between two metallic spheres: n=1.5</li>
<li>Contact between two metallic plates: n=1</li>
</ul>
<p>The above force law leads to the following difficulties:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the damper force becomes larger as the spring force and with
opposite sign, the contact force would be "pulling/sticking" which
is unphysical, since during contact only pushing forces can
occur.</li>
<li>When contact occurs with a non-zero relative speed (which is
the usual situation), the damping force has a non-zero value and
therefore the contact force changes discontinuously at s_rel =
s_rel0. Again, this is not physical because the force can only
change continuously. (Note, this component is not an idealized
model where a steep characteristic is approximated by a
discontinuity, but it shall model the steep characteristic.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the literature there are several proposals to fix problem
(2). Especially, often the following model is used (see, e.g.,
Lankarani, Nikravesh: Continuous Contact Force Models for Impact
Analysis in Multibody Systems, Nonlinear Dynamics 5, pp. 193-207,
1994, <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/h50x61270q06p65n/fulltext.pdf">
pdf-download</a>):</p>
<pre>
   f = c*s_rel^n + (d*s_rel^n)*<b>der</b>(s_rel)
</pre>
<p>However, this and other models proposed in literature violate
issue (1), i.e., unphysical pulling forces can occur (if
d*<b>der</b>(s_rel) becomes large enough). Note, if the force law
is of the form "f = f_c + f_d", then a necessary condition is that
|f_d| ≤ |f_c|, otherwise (1) and (2) are violated. For this reason,
the most simplest approach is used in the ElastoGap model to fix
both problems by using this necessary condition in the force law
directly. If s_rel0 = 0, the equations are:</p>
<pre>
    <b>if</b> s_rel ≥ 0 <b>then</b>
       f = 0;    // contact force
    <b>else</b>
       f_c  = -c*|s_rel|^n;          // contact spring force (Hertzian contact force)
       f_d2 = d*<b>der</b>(s_rel);         // linear contact damper force
       f_d  = <b>if</b> f_d2 &lt;  f_c <b>then</b>  f_c <b>else</b>
              <b>if</b> f_d2 &gt; -f_c <b>then</b> -f_c <b>else</b> f_d2;  // bounded damper force
       f    = f_c + f_d;            // contact force
    <b>end if</b>;
</pre>
<p>Note, since |f_d| ≤ |f_c|, pulling forces cannot occur and the
contact force is always continuous, especially around the start of
the penetration at s_rel = s_rel0.</p>
<p>In the next figure, a typical simulation with the ElastoGap
model is shown (<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Examples.ElastoGap.html">Examples.ElastoGap</a>)
where the different effects are visualized:</p>
<ol>
<li>Curve 1 (elastoGap1.f) is the unmodified contact force, i.e.,
the linear spring/damper characteristic. A pulling/sticking force
is present at the end of the contact.</li>
<li>Curve 2 (elastoGap2.f) is the contact force, where the force is
explicitly set to zero when pulling/sticking occurs. The contact
force is discontinuous when contact starts.</li>
<li>Curve 3 (elastoGap3.f) is the ElastoGap model of this library.
No discontinuity and no pulling/sticking occurs.</li>
</ol>
