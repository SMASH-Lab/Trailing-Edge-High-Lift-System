<h4>Calculation of reluctance forces from lumped magnetic network
models</h4>
<p>Generally, the thrust <i>F</i> developed by a translatory
electro-magneto-mechanical actuator (similar for the rotational
case with torque and angular position) is equal to the change of
magnetic co-energy <i>W<sub>m</sub><sup>*</sup></i> with armature
position <i>x</i> according to</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Magnetic/FluxTubes/UsersGuide/ReluctanceForceCalculation/eq_CoEnergy_general.png" alt="Equation for force calculation from change of magnetic co-energy with armature position" /></p>
<p>(<i>Ψ</i> flux linkage, <i>i</i> actuator current). In lumped
magnetic network models, the above equation simplifies to</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Magnetic/FluxTubes/UsersGuide/ReluctanceForceCalculation/eq_forceFromPermeance_network.png" alt="Equation for force calculation in lumped magnetic network models" /></p>
<p>where <i>n<sub>linear</sub></i> is the number of flux tube
elements with constant relative permeability that change its
permeance <i>G<sub>m i</sub></i> with armature position (index
<i>i</i>), <i>V<sub>m i</sub></i> the magnetic voltage across each
respective flux tube and <i>dG<sub>m i</sub>/dx</i> the derivative
of the respective permeances with respect to armature position.
Transition from the general formula based on magnetic co-energy to
the latter one is outlined in <a href="Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.UsersGuide.Literature.html">[KEQ+12]</a>
for the reciprocal of the permeance, i.e., for the magnetic
reluctance <i>R<sub>m</sub></i>. Note that</p>

<p>with <i>Φ<sub>i</sub></i> being the magnetic flux through each
respective flux tube element.</p>
<p>Flux tube elements with <i>non-linear</i> material
characteristics <i>μ<sub>r</sub></i>(<i>B</i>) in magnetic network
models do not restrict the usability of the above equation.
However, it is required that these nonlinear flux tube elements do
not change its shape with armature motion (e.g., portion of a
solenoid plunger where the magnetic flux passes through in axial
direction). This limitation is not a strong one, since the
permeance of nonlinear, but highly permeable ferromagnetic flux
tube elements and its change with armature position compared to
that of air gap flux tubes can be neglected in most cases. Because
of this constraint, the dimensions of possibly nonlinear flux tube
elements in sub-package <a href="Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.Shapes.FixedShape.html">Shapes.FixedShape</a>
are fixed, whereas the dimension in direction of motion of the
linear flux tube elements in sub-package <a href="Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.Shapes.Force.html">Shapes.Force</a>
can vary during simulation. For the flux tubes defined in this
package with their rather simple shapes, the derivative
<i>dG<sub>m</sub>/dx</i> is given analytically. For more complex
shapes and variations of dimensions with armature motion, it must
be provided analytically during model development, preferably by
extending the partial model <a href="Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.Interfaces.PartialForce.html">Interfaces.PartialForce</a>.</p>
<p>The sub-package <a href="Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.Shapes.Leakage.html">Shapes.Leakage</a>
contains flux tube shapes typical for leakage flux around prismatic
or cylindrical poles. Since the permeance of these flux tubes does
not change with armature position, they do not contribute to a
reluctance actuator's thrust.</p>
