<p>This model demonstrates the differences that occur when using
one- and two-port temperature sensors with and without explicit
junction models. As shown in the next figure, the same system is
shown in 3 different variations. In all cases exactly the same
fluid system is defined. The only difference is how the temperature
is measured:</p>

<p>A pre-defined mass flow rate is present so that fluid flows from
the reservoir to the tanks and after 0.5 s the mass flows from the
tanks to the reservoir. The reservoir has a temperature of
50<sup>0</sup>C whereas the tanks have an initial temperature of
20<sup>0</sup>C and of 80<sup>0</sup>C. The initial height of the
tanks is made in such a form that fluid always flows out of the
cold tank. When the fluid flows from the reservoir to the tanks,
then it mixes with the cold tank and enters the hot tank. When the
fluid flow from the tanks to the reservoir, then the cold and hot
water from the two tanks first mixes and the flows to the
reservoir.</p>
<p>A one-port sensor measures the <em>mixing</em> temperature at a
connection point. Therefore T_onePort.T (the blue curve in the
figure below) is the temperature of the mixing point. A two-port
sensor measures the temperature at the <em>upstream</em> side.
Therefore T_twoPort.T (the red curve in the figure below which is
identical to the green curve) shows first the temperature of the
reservoir and then the mixing temperature when fluid flows from the
tanks to the reservoir. The same is measured with T_junction.T (the
green curve below), because the one-port sensor is connected
between the mass flow source and the junction and since the mixing
takes place in the junction, the same situation is present as for
T_twoPort.T.</p>
