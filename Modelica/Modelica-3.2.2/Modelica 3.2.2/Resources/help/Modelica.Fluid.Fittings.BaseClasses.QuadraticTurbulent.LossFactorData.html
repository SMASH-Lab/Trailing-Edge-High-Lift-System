<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This record defines the pressure loss factors of a pipe segment
(orifice, bending etc.) with a minimum amount of data. If
available, data should be provided for <b>both flow directions</b>,
i.e., flow from port_a to port_b and from port_b to port_a, as well
as for the <b>laminar</b> and the <b>turbulent</b> region. It is
also an option to provide the loss factor <b>only</b> for the
<b>turbulent</b> region for a flow from port_a to port_b.</p>
<p>The following equations are used:</p>
<pre>
   Δp = 0.5*ζ*ρ*v*|v|
      = 0.5*ζ/A^2 * (1/ρ) * m_flow*|m_flow|
      = 8*ζ/(π^2*D^4*ρ) * m_flow*|m_flow|
        Re = |v|*D*ρ/μ

<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li>Δp is the pressure drop: Δp = port_a.p - port_b.p</li>
<li>v is the mean velocity.</li>
<li>ρ is the density.</li>
<li>ζ is the loss factor that depends on the geometry of the pipe.
In the turbulent flow regime, it is assumed that ζ is constant and
is given by "zeta1" and "zeta2" depending on the flow
direction.<br />
When the Reynolds number Re is below "Re_turbulent", the flow is
laminar for small flow velocities. For higher velocities there is a
transition region from laminar to turbulent flow. The loss factor
for laminar flow at small velocities is defined by the often
occurring approximation c0/Re. If c0 is different for the two flow
directions, the mean value has to be used (c0 = (c0_ab +
c0_ba)/2).</li>
<li>The equation "Δp = 0.5*ζ*ρ*v*|v|" is either with respect to
port_a or to port_b, depending on the definition of the particular
loss factor ζ (in some references loss factors are defined with
respect to port_a, in other references with respect to
port_b).</li>
<li>Re = |v|*D_Re*ρ/μ = |m_flow|*D_Re/(A_Re*μ) is the Reynolds
number at the smallest cross section area. This is often at port_a
or at port_b, but can also be between the two ports. In the record,
the diameter D_Re of this smallest cross section area has to be
provided, as well, as Re_turbulent, the absolute value of the
Reynolds number at which the turbulent flow starts. If Re_turbulent
is different for the two flow directions, use the smaller value as
Re_turbulent.</li>
<li>D is the diameter of the pipe. If the pipe has not a circular
cross section, D = 4*A/P, where A is the cross section area and P
is the wetted perimeter.</li>
<li>A is the cross section area with A = π(D/2)^2.</li>
<li>μ is the dynamic viscosity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The laminar and the transition region is usually of not much
technical interest because the operating point is mostly in the
turbulent regime. For simplification and for numerical reasons,
this whole region is described by two polynomials of third order,
one polynomial for m_flow ≥ 0 and one for m_flow &lt; 0. The
polynomials start at Re = |m_flow|*4/(π*D_Re*μ), where D_Re is the
smallest diameter between port_a and port_b. The common derivative
of the two polynomials at Re = 0 is computed from the equation
"c0/Re". Note, the pressure drop equation above in the laminar
region is always defined with respect to the smallest diameter
D_Re.</p>
<p>If no data for c0 is available, the derivative at Re = 0 is
computed in such a way, that the second derivatives of the two
polynomials are identical at Re = 0. The polynomials are
constructed, such that they smoothly touch the characteristic
curves in the turbulent regions. The whole characteristic is
therefore <b>continuous</b> and has a <b>finite</b>, <b>continuous
first derivative everywhere</b>. In some cases, the constructed
polynomials would "vibrate". This is avoided by reducing the
derivative at Re=0 in such a way that the polynomials are
guaranteed to be monotonically increasing. The used sufficient
criteria for monotonicity follows from:</p>
