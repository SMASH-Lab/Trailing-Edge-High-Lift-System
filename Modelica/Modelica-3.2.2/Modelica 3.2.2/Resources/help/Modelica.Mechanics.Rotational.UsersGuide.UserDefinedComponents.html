<p>In this section some hints are given to define your own
1-dimensional rotational components which are compatible with the
elements of this package. It is convenient to define a new
component by inheritance from one of the following base classes,
which are defined in sublibrary Interfaces:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Interfaces.PartialCompliant.html">

<td valign="top">Compliant connection of two rotational 1-dim.
flanges (used for force laws such as a spring or a damper).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Interfaces.PartialCompliantWithRelativeStates.html">
PartialCompliantWithRelativeStates</a></td>
<td valign="top">Same as "PartialCompliant", but relative angle and
relative speed are defined as preferred states. Use this partial
model if the force law needs anyway the relative speed. The
advantage is that it is usually better to use relative angles
between drive train components as states, especially, if the angle
is not limited (e.g., as for drive trains in vehicles).</td>

<p>The difference between these base classes are the auxiliary
variables defined in the model and the relations between the flange
variables already defined in the base class. For example, in model
<b>PartialCompliant</b> there is no support flange, whereas in
model <b>PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2</b> there is a
support flange.</p>
<p>The equations of a mechanical component are vector equations,
i.e., they need to be expressed in a common coordinate system.
Therefore, for a component a <b>local axis of rotation</b> has to
be defined. All vector quantities, such as cut-torques or angular
velocities have to be expressed according to this definition.
Examples for such a definition are given in the following figure
for an inertia component and a planetary gearbox:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/Rotational/driveAxis.png" alt="driveAxis" /></p>
<p>As can be seen, all vectors are directed into the direction of
the rotation axis. The angles in the flanges are defined
correspondingly. For example, the angle <code>sun.phi</code> in the
flange of the sun wheel of the planetary gearbox is positive, if
rotated in mathematical positive direction (= counter clock wise)
along the axis of rotation.</p>
<p>On first view, one may assume that the selected local coordinate
system has an influence on the usage of the component. But this is
not the case, as shown in the next figure:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/Rotational/inertias.png" alt="inertias" /></p>
<p>In the figure the <b>local</b> axes of rotation of the
components are shown. The connection of two inertias in the left
and in the right part of the figure are completely equivalent,
i.e., the right part is just a different drawing of the left part.
This is due to the fact, that by a connection, the two local
coordinate systems are made identical and the (automatically)
generated connection equations (= angles are identical, cut-torques
sum-up to zero) are also expressed in this common coordinate
system. Therefore, even if in the left figure it seems to be that
the angular velocity vector of <code>J2</code> goes from right to
left, in reality it goes from left to right as shown in the right
part of the figure, where the local coordinate systems are drawn
such that they are aligned. Note, that the simple rule stated in
section 4 (Sign conventions) also determines that the angular
velocity of <code>J2</code> in the left part of the figure is
directed from left to right.</p>
<p>To summarize, the local coordinate system selected for a
component is just necessary, in order that the equations of this
component are expressed correctly. The selection of the coordinate
system is arbitrary and has no influence on the usage of the
component. Especially, the actual direction of, e.g., a cut-torque
is most easily determined by the rule of section 4. A more strict
determination by aligning coordinate systems and then using the
vector direction of the local coordinate systems, often requires a
re-drawing of the diagram and is therefore less convenient to
use.</p>
