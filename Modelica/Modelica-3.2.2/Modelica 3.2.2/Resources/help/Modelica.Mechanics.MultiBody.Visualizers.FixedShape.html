<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Model <b>FixedShape</b> defines a visual shape that is shown at
the location of its frame_a. All describing data such as size and
color can vary dynamically by providing appropriate expressions in
the input fields of the parameter menu. The only exception is
parameter shapeType that cannot be changed during simulation. The
following shapes are currently supported via parameter
<b>shapeType</b> (e.g., shapeType="box"):<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Shape.png" alt="model Visualizers.FixedShape" /></p>
<p>The dark blue arrows in the figure above are directed along
variable <b>lengthDirection</b>. The light blue arrows are directed
along variable <b>widthDirection</b>. The <b>coordinate systems</b>
in the figure represent frame_a of the FixedShape component.</p>
<p>Additionally, <b>external shapes</b> can be specified as (not
all options might be supported by all tools):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>"1", "2", ...</b><br />
define external shapes specified in DXF format in files "1.dxf",
"2.dxf", ... The DXF-files must be found either in the current
directory or in the directory where the Shape instance is stored
that references the DXF file. This (very limited) option should not
be used for new models. Example:<br />
shapeType="1".<br /></li>
<li>
"<b>modelica:</b>//&lt;Modelica-name&gt;/&lt;relative-path-file-name&gt;"<br />

characterizes the file that is stored under the location of the
&lt;Modelica-name&gt; library path with the given relative file
name. Example:<br />
shapeType =
"modelica://Modelica/Resources/Data/Shapes/Engine/piston.dxf".<br />
</li>
<li>"<b>file:</b>//&lt;absolute-file-name&gt;"<br />
characterizes an absolute file name in the file system.
Example:<br />
shapeType="file://C:/users/myname/shapes/piston.dxf".</li>
</ul>
<p>The supported file formats are tool dependent. Most tools
support at least DXF-files but may support other format as well
(such as stl, obj, 3ds). Since visualization files contain color
and other data, the corresponding information in the model is
usually ignored. For information about DXF files, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF">Wikipedia</a>. As a
default it is assumed that the DXF coordinates are in the
"frame_a"-system and in meters, and that the 3dfaces are two-sided.
Some tools support only 3dface (for geometry) and layer (for
advanced coloring).</p>
<p>The sizes of any of the above components are specified by the
<b>length</b>, <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> variables. Via
variable <b>extra</b> additional data can be defined:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<th><b>shapeType</b></th>
<th>Meaning of parameter <b>extra</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">"cylinder"</td>
<td valign="top">if extra &gt; 0, a black line is included in the
cylinder to show the rotation of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">"cone"</td>
<td valign="top">extra = diameter-left-side / diameter-right-side,
i.e.,<br />
extra = 1: cylinder<br />
extra = 0: "real" cone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">"pipe"</td>
<td valign="top">extra = outer-diameter / inner-diameter,
i.e,<br />
extra = 1: cylinder that is completely hollow<br />
extra = 0: cylinder without a hole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">"gearwheel"</td>
<td valign="top">extra is the number of teeth of the (external)
gear. If extra &lt; 0, an internal gear is visualized with |extra|
teeth. The axis of the gearwheel is along "lengthDirection", and
usually: width = height = 2*radiusOfGearWheel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">"spring"</td>
<td valign="top">extra is the number of windings of the spring.
Additionally, "height" is <b>not</b> the "height" but
2*coil-width.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">external shape</td>
<td valign="top">extra = 0: Visualization from file is not
scaled.<br />
extra = 1: Visualization from file is scaled with "length", "width"
and height" of the shape</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Parameter <b>color</b> is a vector with 3 elements, {r, g, b},
and specifies the color of the shape. {r,g,b} are the "red",
"green" and "blue" color parts. Note, r g, b are given as
Integer[3] in the ranges 0 .. 255, respectively. The predefined
type <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Types.Color.html">MultiBody.Types.Color</a>
contains a menu definition of the colors used in the MultiBody
library together with a color editor.</p>
