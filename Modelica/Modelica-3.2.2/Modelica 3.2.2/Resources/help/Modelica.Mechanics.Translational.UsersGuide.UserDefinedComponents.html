<p>In this section some hints are given to define your own
1-dimensional translational components which are compatible with
the elements of this package. It is convenient to define a new
component by inheritance from one of the following base classes,
which are defined in sublibrary Interfaces:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Interfaces.PartialCompliant.html">

<td valign="top">Compliant connection of two translational 1-dim.
flanges (used for force laws such as a spring or a damper).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Interfaces.PartialCompliantWithRelativeStates.html">
PartialCompliantWithRelativeStates</a></td>
<td valign="top">Same as "PartialCompliant", but relative position
and relative speed are defined as preferred states. Use this
partial model if the force law needs anyway the relative speed. The
advantage is that it is usually better to use relative positions
between drive train components as states, especially, if the
position is not limited.</td>

<p>The difference between these base classes are the auxiliary
variables defined in the model and the relations between the flange
variables already defined in the base class. For example, in model
<b>PartialCompliant</b> there is no support flange, whereas in
model <b>PartialElementaryTwoFlangesAndSupport2</b> there is a
support flange.</p>
<p>The equations of a mechanical component are vector equations,
i.e., they need to be expressed in a common coordinate system.
Therefore, for a component a <b>local axis of movement</b> has to
be defined. All vector quantities, such as cut-forces or velocities
have to be expressed according to this definition. Examples for
such a definition are given in the following figure for a mass
component:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/Translational/driveAxis.png" alt="driveAxis" /></p>
<p>As can be seen, all vectors are directed into the direction of
the movement axis. The positions in the flanges are defined
correspondingly.</p>
<p>On first view, one may assume that the selected local coordinate
system has an influence on the usage of the component. But this is
not the case, as shown in the next figure:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/Translational/masses.png" alt="masses" /></p>
<p>In the figure the <b>local</b> axes of rotation of the
components are shown. The connection of two masses in the left and
in the right part of the figure are completely equivalent, i.e.,
the right part is just a different drawing of the left part. This
is due to the fact, that by a connection, the two local coordinate
systems are made identical and the (automatically) generated
connection equations (= positions are identical, cut-forces sum-up
to zero) are also expressed in this common coordinate system.
Therefore, even if in the left figure it seems to be that the
velocity vector of <code>m2</code> goes from right to left, in
reality it goes from left to right as shown in the right part of
the figure, where the local coordinate systems are drawn such that
they are aligned. Note, that the simple rule stated in section 4
(Sign conventions) also determines that the velocity of
<code>m2</code> in the left part of the figure is directed from
left to right.</p>
<p>To summarize, the local coordinate system selected for a
component is just necessary, in order that the equations of this
component are expressed correctly. The selection of the coordinate
system is arbitrary and has no influence on the usage of the
component. Especially, the actual direction of, e.g., a cut-force
is most easily determined by the rule of section 4. A more strict
determination by aligning coordinate systems and then using the
vector direction of the local coordinate systems, often requires a
re-drawing of the diagram and is therefore less convenient to
use.</p>
