<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Enumeration to define the discretization structure of
distributed pipe models according to the staggered grid scheme:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<th><b>ModelStructure.</b></th>
<th><b>Meaning</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>av_vb</td>
<td>port_a - volume - flow model - volume - port_b</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</table>
<p>The default is "ModelStructure.av_vb", i.e., the distributed
pipe has "volumes" at its both ends. The advantage is that
connections of the pipe to flow models (like fittings) lead to the
desirable structure of alternating volume and flow models, which
means that no non-linear algebraic equations occur.</p>
<p>Direct connections of distributed pipes with this option means
that two volumes are directly connected together. Due to the stream
concept this means that the pressures of the two connected volumes
are identical, but the temperatures are not set equal (this
corresponds to volumes that are connected together with a very
short distance and it needs some time until different volume
temperatures are equilibrated). Since the pressures of the volumes
are identical, the number of states is reduced and index reduction
takes place (which means that medium equations depending on
pressure are differentiated and the number of required initial
conditions is reduced by one).</p>
<p>The default option "av_vb" cannot be used, if the dynamic pipe
is connected to a model with non-differentiable pressure, like a
Sources.Boundary_pT with prescribed jumping pressure. The
modelStructure can be configured as appropriate in such situations,
in order to place a momentum balance between a pressure state of
the pipe and a non-differentiable boundary condition (e.g., if the
jumping pressure component is connected to port_a, use model
structure ModelStructure.a_vb).</p>
