<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>The Input signal is delayed by a given time instant, or more
precisely:</p>
<pre>
   y = u(time - delayTime) for time &gt; time.start + delayTime
     = u(time.start)       for time â‰¤ time.start + delayTime
</pre>
<p>The delay is approximated by a Pade approximation, i.e., by a
transfer function</p>
<pre>
           b[1]*s^m + b[2]*s^[m-1] + ... + b[m+1]
   y(s) = --------------------------------------------- * u(s)
           a[1]*s^n + a[2]*s^[n-1] + ... + a[n+1]
</pre>
<p>where the coefficients b[:] and a[:] are calculated such that
the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the delay exp(-T*s)
around s=0 are identical up to order n+m.</p>
<p>The main advantage of this approach is that the delay is
approximated by a linear differential equation system, which is
continuous and continuously differentiable. For example, it is
uncritical to linearize a system containing a Pade-approximated
delay.</p>
<p>The standard text book version uses order "m=n", which is also
the default setting of this block. The setting "m=n-1" may yield a
better approximation in certain cases.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to always set parameter
<b>balance</b> = true, in order to arrive at a much better reliable
numerical computation. This is not the default, in order to be
backwards compatible, so you have to explicitly set it. Besides
better numerics, also all states are initialized with
<b>balance</b> = true (in steady-state, so der(x)=0). Longer
explanation:</p>
<p>By default the transfer function of the Pade approximation is
implemented in controller canonical form. This results in
coefficients of the A-matrix in the order of 1 up to the order of
O(1/delayTime)^n. For already modest values of delayTime and n,
this gives largely varying coefficients (for example
delayTime=0.001 and n=4 results in coefficients between 1 and
1e12). In turn, this results in a large norm of the system matrix
[A,B;C,D] and therefore in unreliable numerical computations. When
setting parameter <b>balance</b> = true, a state transformation is
performed that considerably reduces the norm of the system matrix.
This is performed without introducing round-off errors. For details
see function <a href="Modelica.Math.Matrices.balanceABC.html">balanceABC</a>. As a
result, both the simulation of the PadeDelay block, and especially
its linearization becomes more reliable.</p>
