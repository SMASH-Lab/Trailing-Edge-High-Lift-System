<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Joint which does not constrain the motion between frame_a and
frame_b. Such a joint is only meaningful if the <b>relative</b>
distance and orientation between frame_a and frame_b, and their
derivatives, shall be used as <b>states</b>.</p>
<p>Note, that <b>bodies</b> such as Parts.Body, Parts.BodyShape,
have potential states describing the distance and orientation, and
their derivatives, between the <b>world frame</b> and a <b>body
fixed frame</b>. Therefore, if these potential state variables are
suited, a FreeMotion joint is not needed.</p>
<p>The states of the FreeMotion object are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>relative position vector</b> r_rel_a from the origin of
frame_a to the origin of frame_b, resolved in frame_a and the
<b>relative velocity</b> v_rel_a of the origin of frame_b with
respect to the origin of frame_a, resolved in frame_a (=
der(r_rel_a)).</li>
<li>If parameter <b>useQuaternions</b> in the "Advanced" menu is
<b>true</b> (this is the default), then <b>4 quaternions</b> are
states. Additionally, the coordinates of the relative angular
velocity vector are 3 potential states.<br />
If <b>useQuaternions</b> in the "Advanced" menu is <b>false</b>,
then <b>3 angles</b> and the derivatives of these angles are
potential states. The orientation of frame_b is computed by
rotating frame_a along the axes defined in parameter vector
"sequence_angleStates" (default = {1,2,3}, i.e., the Cardan angle
sequence) around the angles used as states. For example, the
default is to rotate the x-axis of frame_a around angles[1], the
new y-axis around angles[2] and the new z-axis around angles[3],
arriving at frame_b.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quaternions have the slight disadvantage that there is a
non-linear constraint equation between the 4 quaternions.
Therefore, at least one non-linear equation has to be solved during
simulation. A tool might, however, analytically solve this simple
constraint equation. Using the 3 angles as states has the
disadvantage that there is a singular configuration in which a
division by zero will occur. If it is possible to determine in
advance for an application class that this singular configuration
is outside of the operating region, the 3 angles might be used as
states by setting <b>useQuaternions</b> = <b>false</b>.</p>
<p>In text books about 3-dimensional mechanics often 3 angles and
the angular velocity are used as states. This is not the case here,
since 3 angles and their derivatives are used as states (if
useQuaternions = false). The reason is that for real-time
simulation the discretization formula of the integrator might be
"inlined" and solved together with the model equations. By
appropriate symbolic transformation the performance is drastically
increased if angles and their derivatives are used as states,
instead of angles and the angular velocity.</p>
<p>If parameter <b>enforceStates</b> is set to <b>true</b> (= the
default) in the "Advanced" menu, then FreeMotion variables are
forced to be used as states according to the setting of parameters
"useQuaternions" and "sequence_angleStates".</p>
<p>In the following figure the animation of a FreeMotion joint is
shown. The light blue coordinate system is frame_a and the dark
blue coordinate system is frame_b of the joint. (here:
r_rel_a_start = {0.5, 0, 0.5}, angles_start = {45, 45,
45}<sup>o</sup>).</p>
