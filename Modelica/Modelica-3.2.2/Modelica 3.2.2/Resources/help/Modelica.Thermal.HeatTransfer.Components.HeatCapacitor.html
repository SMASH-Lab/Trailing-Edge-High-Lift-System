<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This is a generic model for the heat capacity of a material. No
specific geometry is assumed beyond a total volume with uniform
temperature for the entire volume. Furthermore, it is assumed that
the heat capacity is constant (independent of temperature).</p>
<p>The temperature T [Kelvin] of this component is a <b>state</b>.
A default of T = 25 degree Celsius (=
SIunits.Conversions.from_degC(25)) is used as start value for
initialization. This usually means that at start of integration the
temperature of this component is 25 degrees Celsius. You may, of
course, define a different temperature as start value for
initialization. Alternatively, it is possible to set parameter
<b>steadyStateStart</b> to <b>true</b>. In this case the additional
equation '<b>der</b>(T) = 0' is used during initialization, i.e.,
the temperature T is computed in such a way that the component
starts in <b>steady state</b>. This is useful in cases, where one
would like to start simulation in a suitable operating point
without being forced to integrate for a long time to arrive at this
point.</p>
<p>Note, that parameter <b>steadyStateStart</b> is not available in
the parameter menu of the simulation window, because its value is
utilized during translation to generate quite different equations
depending on its setting. Therefore, the value of this parameter
can only be changed before translating the model.</p>
<p>This component may be used for complicated geometries where the
heat capacity C is determined my measurements. If the component
consists mainly of one type of material, the <b>mass m</b> of the
component may be measured or calculated and multiplied with the
<b>specific heat capacity cp</b> of the component material to
compute C:</p>
<pre>
   C = cp*m.
   Typical values for cp at 20 degC in J/(kg.K):
      aluminium   896
      concrete    840
      copper      383
      iron        452
      silver      235
      steel       420 ... 500 (V2A)
      wood       2500
