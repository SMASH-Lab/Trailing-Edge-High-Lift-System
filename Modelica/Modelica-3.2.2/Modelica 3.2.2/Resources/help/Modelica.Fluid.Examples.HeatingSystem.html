<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Simple heating system with a closed flow cycle. After 2000s of
simulation time the valve fully opens. A simple idealized control
is embedded into the respective components, so that the heating
system can be regulated with the valve: the pump controls the
pressure, the burner controls the temperature.</p>
<p>One can investigate the temperatures and flows for different
settings of <code>system.energyDynamics</code> (see Assumptions tab
of the system object).</p>
<ul>
<li>With
<code>system.energyDynamics==Types.Dynamics.FixedInitial</code> the
states need to find their steady values during the simulation.</li>
<li>With
<code>system.energyDynamics==Types.Dynamics.SteadyStateInitial</code>
(default setting) the simulation starts in steady-state.</li>
<li>With
<code>system.energyDynamics==Types.Dynamics.SteadyState</code> all
but one dynamic states are eliminated. The left state
<code>tank.m</code> is to account for the closed flow cycle. It is
constant as outflow and inflow are equal in a steady-state
simulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a closed flow cycle generally causes circular
equalities for the mass flow rates and leaves the pressure
undefined. This is why the tank.massDynamics, i.e., the tank level
determining the port pressure, is modified locally to
Types.Dynamics.FixedInitial.</p>
<p>Also note that the tank is thermally isolated against its
ambient. This way the temperature of the tank is also well defined
for zero flow rate in the heating system, e.g., for
valveOpening.offset=0 at the beginning of a simulation. The pipe
however is assumed to be perfectly isolated. If steady-state values
shall be obtained with the valve fully closed, then a thermal
coupling between the pipe and its ambient should be defined as
well.</p>
<p>Moreover it is worth noting that the idealized direct connection
between the heater and the pipe, resulting in equal port pressures,
is treated as high-index DAE, as opposed to a nonlinear equation
system for connected pressure loss correlations. A pressure loss
correlation could be additionally introduced to model the fitting
between the heater and the pipe, e.g., to adapt different
diameters.</p>
