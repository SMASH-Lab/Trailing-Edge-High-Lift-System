<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This package contains components to model <b>1-dimensional
translational mechanical</b> systems, including different types of
masses, external forces, spring/damper elements, frictional
elements, elastogaps, elements to measure position, velocity,
acceleration and the cut-force of a flange. In sublibrary
<b>Examples</b> several examples are present to demonstrate the
usage of the elements. Just open the corresponding example model
and simulate the model according to the provided description.</p>
<p>A unique feature of this library is the
<b>component-oriented</b> modeling of <b>Coulomb friction</b>
elements, such as support friction. Even (dynamically) coupled
friction elements can be handled <b>without</b> introducing
stiffness which leads to fast simulations. The underlying theory is
new and is based on the solution of mixed continuous/discrete
systems of equations, i.e., equations where the <b>unknowns</b> are
of type <b>Real</b>, <b>Integer</b> or <b>Boolean</b>. Provided
appropriate numerical algorithms for the solution of such types of
systems are available in the simulation tool, the simulation of
(dynamically) coupled friction elements of this library is
<b>efficient</b> and <b>reliable</b>.</p>

<p>A simple example of the usage of this library is given in the
figure above. This drive consists of a shaft with mass m1=1 which
is connected via a spring to a second shaft with mass m2=5. The
left shaft is driven via an external, sinusoidal force. The
<b>filled</b> and <b>non-filled green squares</b> at the left and
right side of a component represent <b>mechanical flanges</b>.
Drawing a line between such squares means that the corresponding
flanges are <b>rigidly attached</b> to each other. By convention in
this library, the connector characterized as a <b>filled</b> green
square is called <b>flange_a</b> and placed at the left side of the
component in the "design view" and the connector characterized as a
<b>non-filled</b> green square is called <b>flange_b</b> and placed
at the right side of the component in the "design view". The two
connectors are completely <b>identical</b>, with the only exception
that the graphical layout is a little bit different in order to
distinguish them for easier access of the connector variables. For
example, <code>m1.flange_a.f</code> is the cut-force in the
connector <code>flange_a</code> of component <code>m1</code>.</p>
<p>The components of this library can be <b>connected</b> together
in an <b>arbitrary</b> way. E.g., it is possible to connect two
springs or two shafts with mass directly together, see figure
below.</p>
