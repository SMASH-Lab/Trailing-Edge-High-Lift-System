<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>One important special case for a pressure loss is the friction
at the wall of a pipe under the assumption of quasi steady state
flow (i.e., the mass flow rate varies only slowly). In this section
it is explained how this case is handled in the Modelica.Fluid
library for pipes with <b>nonuniform roughness</b>, including the
smooth pipe as a special case (see <a href="Modelica.Fluid.Pipes.BaseClasses.WallFriction.html">Pipes.BaseClasses.WallFriction</a>).
The treatment is non-standard in order to get a numerically
well-posed description.</p>
<p>For pipes with circular cross section the pressure drop is
computed as:</p>
<pre>
   dp = λ(Re,<font face="Symbol">D</font>)*(L/D)*ρ*v*|v|/2
      = λ(Re,<font face="Symbol">D</font>)*8*L/(π^2*D^5*ρ)*m_flow*|m_flow|
      = λ2(Re,<font face="Symbol">D</font>)*k2*sign(m_flow);

with
   Re     = |v|*D*ρ/μ
          = |m_flow|*4/(π*D*μ)
   m_flow = A*v*ρ
   A      = π*(D/2)^2
   λ2     = λ*Re^2
   k2     = L*μ^2/(2*D^3*ρ)
</pre>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li>L is the length of the pipe.</li>
<li>D is the diameter of the pipe. If the pipe has not a circular
cross section, D = 4*A/P, where A is the cross section area and P
is the wetted perimeter.</li>
<li>λ = λ(Re,<font face="Symbol">D</font>) is the "usual" wall
friction coefficient.</li>
<li>λ2 = λ*Re^2 is the used friction coefficient to get a
numerically well-posed formulation.</li>
<li>Re = |v|*D*ρ/μ is the Reynolds number.</li>
<li><font face="Symbol">D</font> = <font face="Symbol">d</font>/D
is the relative roughness where "<font face="Symbol">d</font>" is
the absolute "roughness", i.e., the averaged height of asperities
in the pipe (<font face="Symbol">d</font> may change over time due
to growth of surface asperities during service, see <i>[Idelchick
1994, p. 85, Tables 2-1, 2-2])</i>.</li>
<li>ρ is the upstream density.</li>
<li>μ is the upstream dynamic viscosity.</li>
<li>v is the mean velocity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first form with λ is used and presented in textbooks, see
"blue" curve in the next figure:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Fluid/Components/PipeFriction1.png" alt="PipeFriction1" /></p>
<p>This form is not suited for a simulation program since λ = 64/Re
if Re &lt; 2000, i.e., a division by zero occurs for zero mass flow
rate because Re = 0 in this case. More useful for a simulation
model is the friction coefficient λ2 = λ*Re^2, because λ2 = 64*Re
if Re &lt; 2000 and therefore no problems for zero mass flow rate
occur. The characteristic of λ2 is shown in the next figure and is
used in Modelica.Fluid:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Fluid/Components/PipeFriction2.png" alt="PipeFriction2" /></p>
<p>The pressure loss characteristic is divided into three
regions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Region 1</b>: For <b>Re ≤ 2000</b>, the flow is
<b>laminar</b> and the exact solution of the 3-dim. Navier-Stokes
equations (momentum and mass balance) is used under the assumptions
of steady flow, constant pressure gradient and constant density and
viscosity (= Hagen-Poiseuille flow) leading to λ2 = 64*Re.
Therefore:
<pre>
 dp = 128*μ*L/(π*D^4*ρ)*m_flow 
</pre>
<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Region 3</b>: For <b>Re ≥ 4000</b>, the flow is
<b>turbulent</b>. Depending on the calculation direction (see
"inverse formulation" below) either of two explicit equations are
used. If the pressure drop dp is assumed to be known, λ2 = |dp|/k2.
The Colebrook-White equation <i>[Colebrook 1939; Idelchik 1994, p.
83, eq. (2-9)]</i>:
<pre>
1/sqrt(λ) = -2*lg( 2.51/(Re*sqrt(λ)) + 0.27*<font face="Symbol">D</font>) 
</pre>
gives an implicit relationship between Re and λ. Inserting λ2 =
λ*Re^2 allows to solve this equation analytically for Re:
<pre>
Re = -2*sqrt(λ2)*lg(2.51/sqrt(λ2) + 0.27*<font face="Symbol">D</font>)
</pre>
Finally, the mass flow rate m_flow is computed from Re via m_flow =
Re*π*D*μ/4*sign(dp). These are the <b>red</b> curves in the
diagrams above.<br />
If the mass flow rate is assumed known (and therefore implicitly
also the Reynolds number), then λ2 is computed by an approximation
of the inverse of the Colebrook-White equation <i>[Swamee and Jain
1976; Miller 1990, p. 191, eq.(8.4)]</i> adapted to λ2:
<pre>
 λ2 = 0.25*(Re/lg(<font face="Symbol">D</font>/3.7 + 5.74/Re^0.9))^2 
</pre>
The pressure drop is then computed as dp = k2*λ2*sign(m_flow).
These are the <b>blue</b> curves in the diagrams above.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Region 2</b>: For <b>2000 ≤ Re ≤ 4000</b> there is a
transition region between laminar and turbulent flow. The value of
λ2 depends on more factors as just the Reynolds number and the
relative roughness, therefore only crude approximations are
possible in this area.<br />
The deviation from the laminar region depends on the relative
roughness. A laminar flow at Re=2000 is only reached for smooth
pipes. The deviation Reynolds number Re1 is computed according to
<i>[Samoilenko 1968; Idelchik 1994, p. 81, sect. 2.1.21]</i> as:
<pre>
Re1 = 745*e^(if <font face="Symbol">D</font> ≤ 0.0065 then 1 else 0.0065/<font face="Symbol">D</font>)
</pre>
These are the <b>blue</b> curves in the diagrams above.<br />
Between Re1=Re1(<font face="Symbol">d</font>/D) and Re2=4000, λ2 is
approximated by a cubic polynomial in the "lg(λ2) - lg(Re)" chart
(see figures above) such that the first derivative is continuous at
these two points. In order to avoid the solution of non-linear
equations, two different cubic polynomials are used for the direct
and the inverse formulation. This leads to some discrepancies in λ2
(= differences between the red and the blue curves). This is
acceptable, because the transition region is anyway not precisely
known since the actual friction coefficient depends on additional
factors and since the operating points are usually not in this
region.</li>
</ul>
<p>The absolute roughness <font face="Symbol">d</font> has usually
to be estimated. In <i>[Idelchik 1994, pp. 105-109, Table 2-5;
Miller 1990, p. 190, Table 8-1]</i> many examples are given. As a
short summary:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">

<p>The equations above are valid for incompressible flow. They can
also be applied for <b>compressible</b> flow up to about <b>Ma =
0.6</b> (Ma is the Mach number) with a maximum error in λ of about
3 %. The effect of gas compressibility in a wide region can be
taken into account by the following formula derived by Voronin
<i>[Voronin 1959; Idelchick 1994, p. 97, sect. 2.1.81]</i>:</p>
<pre>
  λ_comp = λ*(1 + (κ-1)/2 * Ma^2)^(-0.47)
</pre>
<p>where κ is the isentropic coefficient (for ideal gases, κ is the
ratio of specific heat capacities cp/cv). An appreciable decrease
in the coefficient "λ_comp" is observed only in a narrow transonic
region and also at supersonic flow velocities by about 15%
<i>[Idelchick 1994, p. 97, sect. 2.1.81]</i>. This effect is not
yet included in Modelica.Fluid. Another restriction is that the
pressure drop model is valid only for steady state or slowly
changing mass flow rate. For large fluid acceleration, the pressure
drop depends additionally on the frequency of the changing mass
flow rate.</p>
<h4>Inverse formulation</h4>
<p>In the "Advanced menu" it is possible via parameter "from_dp" to
define in which form the pressure drop equation is actually
evaluated (<b>default</b> is from_dp = <b>true</b>):</p>
<pre>
   from_dp = <b>true</b>:   m_flow = f1(dp)
           = <b>false</b>:  dp     = f2(m_flow)
</pre>
<p>"from_dp" can be useful to avoid nonlinear systems of equations
in cases where the inverse pressure loss function is needed.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>A detailed pressure drop model for pipe wall friction is
provided in the form m_flow = f1(dp, <font face="Symbol">D</font>)
or dp = f2(m_flow, <font face="Symbol">D</font>). These functions
are continuous and differentiable, are provided in an explicit form
without solving non-linear equations, and do behave well also at
small mass flow rates. This pressure drop model can be used
stand-alone in a static momentum balance and in a dynamic momentum
balance as the friction pressure drop term. It is valid for
incompressible and compressible flow up to a Mach number of
0.6.</p>
