<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This example demonstrates how to generate an input/output block
(e.g. in form of an FMU - <a href="https://www.fmi-standard.org">Functional Mock-up Unit</a>) from
various Rotational components. The goal is to export such an
input/output block from Modelica and import it in another modeling
environment. The essential issue is that before exporting it must
be known in which way the component is utilized in the target
environment. Depending on the target usage, different flange
variables need to be in the interface with either input or output
causality. Note, this example model can be used to test the FMU
export/import of a Modelica tool. Just export the components marked
in the icons as "toFMU" as FMUs and import them back. The models
should then still work and give the same results as a pure Modelica
model.</p>
<p><b>Connecting two inertias</b><br />
The upper part (DirectInertia, InverseInertia) demonstrates how to
export two inertias and connect them together in a target system.
This requires that one of the inertias (here: DirectInertia) is
defined to have states and the angle, angular velocity and angular
acceleration are provided in the interface. The other inertia
(here: InverseInertia) is moved according to the provided input
angle, angular velocity and angular acceleration.</p>
<p><b>Connecting a force element that needs angles and angular
velocities</b><br />
The middle part (SpringDamper) demonstrates how to export a force
element that needs both angles and angular velocities for its force
law and connect this force law in a target system between two
inertias.</p>
<p><b>Connecting a force element that needs only angles</b><br />
The lower part (Spring) demonstrates how to export a force element
that needs only angles for its force law and connect this force law
in a target system between two inertias.</p>
