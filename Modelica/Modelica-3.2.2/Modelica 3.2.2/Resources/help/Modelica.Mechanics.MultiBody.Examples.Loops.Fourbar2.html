<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This is a second version of the "four-bar" mechanism, see
figure:</p>
<img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Examples/Loops/Fourbar2.png" alt="model Examples.Loops.Fourbar2" />
<p>In this case the three revolute joints on the left top-side and
the two revolute joints on the right top side have been replaced by
the joint <b>UniversalSpherical</b> that is a rod connecting a
spherical and a universal joint. This joint is defined by <b>1
constraint</b> stating that the distance between the two spherical
joints is constant. Using this joint in a kinematic loop reduces
the sizes of non-linear algebraic equations. For this loop, only
one non-linear algebraic system of equations of order 1
remains.</p>
<p>At the UniversalSpherical joint an additional frame_ia fixed to
the rod is present where components can be attached to the
connecting rod. In this example just a coordinate system is
attached to visualize frame_ia (coordinate system on the right in
blue color).</p>
<p>Another feature is that the length of the connecting rod can be
automatically calculated during <b>initialization</b>. In order to
do this, another initialization condition has to be given. In this
example, the initial value of the distance of the prismatic joint
j2 has been fixed (via the "Initialization" menu) and the rod
length of joint "UniversalSpherical" is computed during
initialization since parameter <b>computeLength</b> = <b>true</b>
is set in the joint parameter menu. The main advantage is that
during initialization no non-linear system of equation is solved
and therefore initialization always works. To be precise, the
following trivial non-linear equation is actually solved for
rodLength:</p>
<pre>
   rodLength*rodLength = f(angle of revolute joint, distance of prismatic joint)
