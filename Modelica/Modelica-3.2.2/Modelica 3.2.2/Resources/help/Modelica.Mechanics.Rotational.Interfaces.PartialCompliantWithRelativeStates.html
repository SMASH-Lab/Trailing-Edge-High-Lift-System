<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This is a 1-dim. rotational component with a compliant
connection of two rotational 1-dim. flanges where inertial effects
between the two flanges are neglected. The basic assumption is that
the cut-torques of the two flanges sum-up to zero, i.e., they have
the same absolute value but opposite sign: flange_a.tau +
flange_b.tau = 0. This base class is used to built up force
elements such as springs, dampers, friction.</p>
<p>The relative angle and the relative speed are defined as
preferred states. The reason is that for some drive trains, such as
drive trains in vehicles, the absolute angle is quickly increasing
during operation. Numerically, it is better to use relative angles
between drive train components because they remain in a limited
size. For this reason, StateSelect.prefer is set for the relative
angle of this component.</p>
<p>In order to improve the numerics, a nominal value for the
relative angle can be provided via parameter <b>phi_nominal</b> in
the Advanced menu. The default is 1e-4 rad since relative angles
are usually in this order and the step size control of an
integrator would be practically switched off, if a default of 1 rad
would be used. This nominal value might also be computed from other
values, such as "phi_nominal = tau_nominal / c" for a rotational
spring, if tau_nominal and c are more meaningful for the user.</p>
