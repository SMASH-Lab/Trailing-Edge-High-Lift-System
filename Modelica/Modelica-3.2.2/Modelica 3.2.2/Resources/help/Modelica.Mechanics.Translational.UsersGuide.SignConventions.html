<p>The variables of a component of this library can be accessed in
the usual way. However, since most of these variables are basically
elements of <b>vectors</b>, i.e., have a direction, the question
arises how the signs of variables shall be interpreted. The basic
idea is explained at hand of the following figure:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/Translational/drive2.png" alt="drive2" /></p>
<p>First, one has to define a <b>positive</b> direction of this
line, called <b>axis of movement</b>. In the top part of the figure
this is characterized by an arrow defined as <code>axis of
movement</code>. The simple rule is now: If a variable of a
component is positive and can be interpreted as the element of a
vector (e.g., force or velocity vector), the corresponding vector
is directed into the positive direction of the axis of movement. In
the following figure, the right-most mass of the figure above is
displayed with the positive vector direction displayed according to
this rule:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/Translational/drive3.png" alt="drive3" /></p>
<p>The cut-force <code>m2.flange_a.f</code> of the right mass is
directed into the direction of movement if the values are positive.
Similarly, the velocity <code>m2.v</code> of the right mass is also
directed into the direction of movement if the values are
positive</p>
