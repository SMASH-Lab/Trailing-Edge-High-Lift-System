<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<h4>Version 0.87, 2004-06-23</h4>
<ul>
<li>Included in Modelica standard library 2.0 Beta 1 with the new
block connectors. Changed all the references to the block
connectors and the Logical library correspondingly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.86, 2004-06-20</h4>
<ul>
<li>New components "Alternative" and "Parallel" for alternative and
parallel execution paths.</li>
<li>A step has now a vector of input and output connectors in order
that multiple connections to and from a step are possible</li>
<li>Removed components "AlternativeSplit", "AlternativeJoin",
"ParallelSplit" and "ParallelJoin" since the newly introduced
components ("Alternative", "Parallel", vector connectors of steps)
have the same modeling power but are safer and more
convenient.</li>
<li>Removed the timer in a step (attach instead Logical.Timer to
the "active" port of a "StepWithSignal" component). Note, that in
most cases it is more convenient and more efficient to use the
built-in timer of a transition.</li>
<li>Component "StepInitial" renamed to "InitialStep".</li>
<li>New component "Timer" within sublibrary Logical.</li>
<li>Updated and improved documentation of the library.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.85, 2004-06-17</h4>
<ul>
<li>Renamed "MacroStep" to "CompositeStep" and the ports of the
MacroStep from "abort" to "suspend" and "history" to "resume".</li>
<li>Nested "CompositeStep" components are supported, based on the
experimental feature of nested inner/outer components introduced by
Dymola. This means that CompositeSteps can be suspended and resumed
at every level.</li>
<li>New example "Examples.ShowExceptions" to demonstrate the new
feature of nested CompositeSteps.</li>
<li>New package "Logical". It contains all components of
ModelicaAdditions.Blocks.Logical, but with new block connectors and
nicer icons. Additionally, logical blocks are also added.</li>
<li>Improved icons for several components of the StateGraph
library.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.83, 2004-05-21</h4>
<ul>
<li>The "abort" and "history" connectors are no longer visible in
the diagram layer of a CompositeStep since it is not allowed to
connect to them in a CompositeStep.</li>
<li>Made the diagram/icon size of a CompositeStep smaller (from
200/-200 to 150/-150).</li>
<li>Improved icons for "SetBoolean/SetInteger/SetReal"
components.</li>
<li>Renamed "ParameterReal" to "SetRealParameter".</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 0.82, 2004-05-18</h4>
<p>Implemented a first version that is provided to other
people.</p>
