<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This element describes <b>Coulomb friction</b> in
<b>support</b>, i.e., a frictional force acting between a flange
and the housing. The positive sliding friction force "f" has to be
defined by table "f_pos" as function of the absolute velocity "v".
E.g.</p>
<pre>
       v |   f
      ---+-----
       0 |   0
       1 |   2
       2 |   5
       3 |   8
</pre>
<p>gives the following table:</p>
<pre>
   f_pos = [0, 0; 1, 2; 2, 5; 3, 8];
</pre>
<p>Currently, only linear interpolation in the table is supported.
Outside of the table, extrapolation through the last two table
entries is used. It is assumed that the negative sliding friction
force has the same characteristic with negative values. Friction is
modelled in the following way:</p>
<p>When the absolute velocity "v" is not zero, the friction force
is a function of v and of a constant normal force. This dependency
is defined via table f_pos and can be determined by measurements,
e.g., by driving the gear with constant velocity and measuring the
needed driving force (= friction force).</p>
<p>When the absolute velocity becomes zero, the elements connected
by the friction element become stuck, i.e., the absolute position
remains constant. In this phase the friction force is calculated
from a force balance due to the requirement, that the absolute
acceleration shall be zero. The elements begin to slide when the
friction force exceeds a threshold value, called the maximum static
friction force, computed via:</p>
<pre>
   maximum_static_friction = <b>peak</b> * sliding_friction(v=0)  (<b>peak</b> &gt;= 1)
</pre>
<p>This procedure is implemented in a "clean" way by state events
and leads to continuous/discrete systems of equations if friction
elements are dynamically coupled which have to be solved by
appropriate numerical methods. The method is described in (see also
a short sketch in <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.UsersGuide.ModelingOfFriction.html">
UsersGuide.ModelingOfFriction</a>):</p>

</dl>
<p>More precise friction models take into account the elasticity of
the material when the two elements are "stuck", as well as other
effects, like hysteresis. This has the advantage that the friction
element can be completely described by a differential equation
without events. The drawback is that the system becomes stiff
(about 10-20 times slower simulation) and that more material
constants have to be supplied which requires more sophisticated
identification. For more details, see the following references,
