<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This example demonstrates two aspects: the treatment of
multi-way connections and the usage of an incompressible medium
model.</p>
<p>Eleven pipe models with nNodes=2 each introduce 22 temperature
states and and 22 pressure states. When configuring
<b>pipeModelStructure=a_v_b</b>, the flow models at the pipe ports
constitute algebraic loops for the pressures. A common work-around
is to introduce "mixing volumes" in critical connections.</p>
<p>Here the problem is treated alternatively with the default
<b>pipeModelStructure=av_vb</b> of the <a href="Modelica.Fluid.Pipes.DynamicPipe.html">DynamicPipe</a>
model. Each pipe exposes the states of the outer fluid segments to
the respective fluid ports. Consequently the pressures of all
connected pipe segments get lumped together into one mass balance
spanning the whole connection set. Overall this treatment as
high-index DAE results in the reduction to 9 pressure states,
preventing algebraic loops in connections. This can be studied with
a rigorous medium model like <b>StandardWaterOnePhase</b>.</p>
<p>The pressure dynamics completely disappears with an
incompressible medium model, like the used <b>Glycol47</b>. It
appears reasonable to assume steady-state mass balances in this
case (see parameter systemMassDynamics used in system.massDynamics,
tab Assumptions).</p>
<p>Note that with the stream concept in the fluid ports, the energy
and substance balances of the connected pipe segments remain
independent from each other, despite of pressures being lumped
together. The following simulation results can be observed:</p>
<ol>
<li>The simulation starts with system.T_ambient as initial
temperature in all pipes. The temperatures upstream or bypassing
pipe8 are approaching the value of 26.85 degC from the source,
including also pipe9. The temperatures downstream of pipe8 take a
higher value, depending on the mixing with heated fluid, see e.g.
pipe10.</li>
<li>After 50s valve1 fully closes. This causes flow reversal in
pipe8. Now heated fluid flows from pipe8 to pipe9. Note that the
temperature of the connected pipe7 remains unchanged as there is no
flow into pipe7. The temperature of pipe10 cools down to the source
temperature.</li>
<li>After 100s valve2 closes half way, which affects mass flow
rates and temperatures.</li>
<li>After 150s valve5 closes half way, which affects mass flow
rates and temperatures.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fluid temperatures in the pipes of interest are exposed
through heatPorts.</p>
