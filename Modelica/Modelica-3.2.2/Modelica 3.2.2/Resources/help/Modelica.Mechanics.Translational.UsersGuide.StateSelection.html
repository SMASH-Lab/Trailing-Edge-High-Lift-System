<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Only a few components of the Translational library use the
der(..) operator and are therefore candidates to have states. Most
important, component <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Components.Mass.html">Mass</a>
defines the absolute position and the absolute velocity of this
component as candidate for states. In the "Advanced" menu the
built-in StateSelect enumeration can be set to define the priority
to use these variables as states. Without further action, in most
cases a tool will select these variables as states.</p>
<p>For positioning drive trains where the goal is to position a
load, the absolute positions of the components are bounded, and the
issue discussed below is not present.</p>
<p>For drive trains where the goal is to control the velocity of a
load, the absolute positions of the components are quickly
increasing during operation. This is critical, because then the
step size control of time integrators might then no longer work
appropriately:</p>
<p>Integrators with step size control adjust their time step size
automatically to meet user defined error bounds ("tolerances").
Typically the local error estimate EST_i is compared with a mixed
bound for absolute and relative errors.</p>
<pre>
   EST_i â‰¤ abstol_i + reltol_i*|x_i|
</pre>
<p>Here, abstol_i and reltol_i denote the bounds for the absolute
and relative error of state variable x_i, respectively. This mixed
error bound is used since it is more robust than a pure relative
error based error bound if the nominal value x_i is (very) close to
0. In a Modelica simulation model, typically the same relative
tolerance reltol is used for all states and the absolute tolerances
are computed using the relative tolerance and the nominal values of
the states:</p>
<pre>
   reltol_i = reltol
   abstol_i = reltol*x_i(nominal)*0.01
</pre>
<p>This error control fails if the state variable x_i grows without
bounds (such as for a drive train), since then the allowed error
also grows without bounds. The effect is that the error control on
this variable is practically switched off. The correct way to
handle this would be to set reltol_i = 0 on such a state variable
and only use an absolute tolerance for the step size control.</p>
<p>Currently, in Modelica there is no possibility to provide this
information. In order to reduce this effect, it is advisable to not
use absolute angles, but relative angles as states. A user can
define relative variables as states explicitly with component
<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Components.RelativeStates.html">
RelativeStates</a>. Furthermore, all compliant components, such as
<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Components.SpringDamper.html">
SpringDamper</a> are defining the relative position and the
relative velocity as preferred states. Therefore, a tool will
select in most cases relative positions as states.</p>
<p>The relative positions of compliant components are usually
small. Without further action, the error control would not work
properly on variables that are so small (so often switching the
error control off). The remedy is to define explicitly a nominal
value on the relative angle. This definition is provided in the
"Advanced" menu of the compliant components with parameter
"s_nominal". The default value is 1e-4 m, to be in the order of a
compliant deformation of a drive.</p>
