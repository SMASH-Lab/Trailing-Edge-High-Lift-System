<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component consists of a <b>universal</b> joint at frame_a,
a <b>revolute</b> joint at frame_b and a <b>spherical</b> joint
which is connected via <b>rod1</b> to the universal and via
<b>rod2</b> to the revolute joint, see the default animation in the
following figure (the axes vectors are not part of the default
animation):</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Joints/JointUSR.png" alt="model Joints.Assemblies.JointUSR" /></p>
<p>This joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia and introduces
neither constraints nor potential state variables. It should be
used in kinematic loops whenever possible since the non-linear
system of equations introduced by this joint aggregation is solved
<b>analytically</b> (i.e., a solution is always computed, if a
unique solution exists).</p>
<p>The universal joint is defined in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rotation <b>axis</b> of revolute joint <b>1</b> is along
parameter vector n1_a which is fixed in frame_a.</li>
<li>The rotation <b>axis</b> of revolute joint <b>2</b> is
perpendicular to axis 1 and to the line connecting the universal
and the spherical joint (= rod 1).</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of axis 2 of the universal joint is performed
according to the most often occurring case. In a future release,
axis 2 might be explicitly definable via a parameter. However, the
treatment is much more complicated and the number of operations is
considerably higher, if axis 2 is not orthogonal to axis 1 and to
the connecting rod.</p>
<p>Note, there is a <b>singularity</b> when axis 1 and the
connecting rod are parallel to each other. Therefore, if possible
n1_a should be selected in such a way that it is perpendicular to
rRod1_ia in the initial configuration (i.e., the distance to the
singularity is as large as possible).</p>
<p>The rest of this joint aggregation is defined by the following
parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The position of the spherical joint with respect to the
universal joint is defined by vector <b>rRod1_ia</b>. This vector
is directed from frame_a to the spherical joint and is resolved in
frame_ia (it is most simple to select frame_ia such that it is
parallel to frame_a in the reference or initial
configuration).</li>
<li>The position of the spherical joint with respect to the
revolute joint is defined by vector <b>rRod2_ib</b>. This vector is
directed from the inner frame of the revolute joint (frame_ib or
revolute.frame_a) to the spherical joint and is resolved in
frame_ib (note, that frame_ib and frame_b are parallel to each
other).</li>
<li>The axis of rotation of the revolute joint is defined by axis
vector <b>n_b</b>. It is fixed and resolved in frame_b.</li>
<li>When specifying this joint aggregation with the definitions
above, <b>two</b> different <b>configurations</b> are possible. Via
parameter <b>phi_guess</b> a guess value for revolute.phi(t0) at
the initial time t0 is given. The configuration is selected that is
closest to phi_guess (|revolute.phi - phi_guess| is minimal).</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional <b>frame_ia</b> is present. It is <b>fixed</b> in
the rod connecting the universal and the spherical joint at the
origin of <b>frame_a</b>. The placement of frame_ia on the rod is
implicitly defined by the universal joint (frame_a and frame_ia
coincide when the angles of the two revolute joints of the
universal joint are zero) and by parameter vector <b>rRod1_ia</b>,
the position vector from the origin of frame_a to the spherical
joint, resolved in frame_<b>ia</b>.</p>
<p>An additional <b>frame_ib</b> is present. It is <b>fixed</b> in
the rod connecting the revolute and the spherical joint at the side
of the revolute joint that is connected to this rod (= rod2.frame_a
= revolute.frame_a).</p>
<p>An additional <b>frame_im</b> is present. It is <b>fixed</b> in
the rod connecting the revolute and the spherical joint at the side
of the spherical joint that is connected to this rod (=
rod2.frame_b). It is always parallel to <b>frame_ib</b>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <b>reference configuration</b>
where <b>all frames</b> of all components are <b>parallel</b> to
each other (alternatively, at least frame_a and frame_ia of the
JointUSR joint should be parallel to each other when defining an
instance of this component).</p>
<p>In the public interface of the JointUSR joint, the following
(final) <b>parameters</b> are provided:</p>
<pre>
  <b>parameter</b> Real rod1Length(unit="m")  "Length of rod 1";
  <b>parameter</b> Real eRod1_ia[3] "Unit vector along rod 1, resolved in frame_ia";
  <b>parameter</b> Real e2_ia  [3]  "Unit vector along axis 2, resolved in frame_ia";
</pre>
<p>This allows a more convenient definition of data which is
related to rod 1. For example, if a box shall be connected at
frame_ia directing from the origin of frame_a to the middle of rod
1, this might be defined as:</p>
<pre>
    Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.Assemblies.JointUSP jointUSR(rRod1_ia={1.2, 1, 0.2});
    Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Visualizers.FixedShape     shape(shapeType       = "box",
                                               lengthDirection = jointUSR.eRod1_ia,
                                               widthDirection  = jointUSR.e2_ia,
                                               length          = jointUSR.rod1Length/2,
                                               width           = jointUSR.rod1Length/10);
  <b>equation</b>
    <b>connect</b>(jointUSP.frame_ia, shape.frame_a);
