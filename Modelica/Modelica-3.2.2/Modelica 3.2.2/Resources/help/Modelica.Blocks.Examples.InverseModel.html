<p>This example demonstrates how to construct an inverse model in
Modelica (for more details see <a href="https://www.modelica.org/events/Conference2005/online_proceedings/Session3/Session3c3.pdf">
Looye, Th√ºmmel, Kurze, Otter, Bals: Nonlinear Inverse Models for
Control</a>).</p>
<p>For a linear, single input, single output system</p>
<pre>
   y = n(s)/d(s) * u   // plant model
</pre>
<p>the inverse model is derived by simply exchanging the numerator
and the denominator polynomial:</p>
<pre>
   u = d(s)/n(s) * y   // inverse plant model
</pre>
<p>If the denominator polynomial d(s) has a higher degree as the
numerator polynomial n(s) (which is usually the case for plant
models), then the inverse model is no longer proper, i.e., it is
not causal. To avoid this, an approximate inverse model is
constructed by adding a sufficient number of poles to the
denominator of the inverse model. This can be interpreted as
filtering the desired output signal y:</p>
<pre>
   u = d(s)/(n(s)*f(s)) * y  // inverse plant model with filtered y
</pre>
<p>With Modelica it is in principal possible to construct inverse
models not only for linear but also for non-linear models and in
particular for every Modelica model. The basic construction
mechanism is explained at hand of this example:</p>
<img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Blocks/InverseModelSchematic.png" alt="InverseModelSchematic.png" />
<p>Here the first order block "firstOrder1" shall be inverted. This
is performed by connecting its inputs and outputs with an instance
of block Modelica.Blocks.Math.<b>InverseBlockConstraints</b>. By
this connection, the inputs and outputs are exchanged. The goal is
to compute the input of the "firstOrder1" block so that its output
follows a given sine signal. For this, the sine signal "sin" is
first filtered with a "CriticalDamping" filter of order 1 and then
the output of this filter is connected to the output of the
"firstOrder1" block (via the InverseBlockConstraints block, since 2
outputs cannot be connected directly together in a block
diagram).</p>
<p>In order to check the inversion, the computed input of
"firstOrder1" is used as input in an identical block "firstOrder2".
The output of "firstOrder2" should be the given "sine" function.
The difference is constructed with the "feedback" block. Since the
"sine" function is filtered, one cannot expect that this difference
is zero. The higher the cut-off frequency of the filter, the closer
is the agreement. A typical simulation result is shown in the next
figure:</p>
