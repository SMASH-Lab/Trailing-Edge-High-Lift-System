<p>With this example the controller of a tank filling/emptying
system is demonstrated. This example is from Dressler (2004), see
<a href="Modelica.StateGraph.UsersGuide.Literature.html">Literature</a>.
The basic operation is to fill and empty the two tanks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Valve 1 is opened and tank 1 is filled.</li>
<li>When tank 1 reaches its fill level limit, valve 1 is
closed.</li>
<li>After a waiting time, valve 2 is opened and the fluid flows
from tank 1 into tank 2.</li>
<li>When tank 1 is empty, valve 2 is closed.</li>
<li>After a waiting time, valve 3 is opened and the fluid flows out
of tank 2</li>
<li>When tank 3 is empty, valve 3 is closed</li>
</ol>
<p>The above "normal" process can be influenced by three
buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Button <b>start</b> starts the above process. When this button
is pressed after a "stop" or "shut" operation, the process
operation continues.</li>
<li>Button <b>stop</b> stops the above process by closing all
valves. Then, the controller waits for further input (either
"start" or "shut" operation).</li>
<li>Button <b>shut</b> is used to shutdown the process, by emptying
at once both tanks. When this is achieved, the process goes back to
its start configuration. Clicking on "start", restarts the
process.</li>
</ul>
