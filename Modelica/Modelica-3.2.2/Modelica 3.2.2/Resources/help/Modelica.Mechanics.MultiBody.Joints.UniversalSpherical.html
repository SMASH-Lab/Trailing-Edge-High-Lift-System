<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component consists of a <b>universal joint</b> at frame_a
and a <b>spherical joint</b> at frame_b that are connected together
with a <b>rigid rod</b>, see default animation figure (the arrows
are not part of the default animation):</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Joints/UniversalSpherical.png" alt="model Joints.UniversalSpherical" /></p>
<p>This joint aggregation has no mass and no inertia and introduces
the constraint that the distance between the origin of frame_a and
the origin of frame_b is constant (= Frames.length(rRod_ia)). The
universal joint is defined in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rotation <b>axis</b> of revolute joint <b>1</b> is along
parameter vector n1_a which is fixed in frame_a.</li>
<li>The rotation <b>axis</b> of revolute joint <b>2</b> is
perpendicular to axis 1 and to the line connecting the universal
and the spherical joint.</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of axis 2 of the universal joint is performed
according to the most often occurring case. In a future release,
axis 2 might be explicitly definable via a parameter. However, the
treatment is much more complicated and the number of operations is
considerably higher, if axis 2 is not orthogonal to axis 1 and to
the connecting rod.</p>
<p>Note, there is a <b>singularity</b> when axis 1 and the
connecting rod are parallel to other. Therefore, if possible n1_a
should be selected in such a way that it is perpendicular to
rRod_ia in the initial configuration (i.e., the distance to the
singularity is as large as possible).</p>
<p>An additional <b>frame_ia</b> is present. It is <b>fixed</b> in
the connecting <b>rod</b> at the origin of <b>frame_a</b>. The
placement of frame_ia on the rod is implicitly defined by the
universal joint (frame_a and frame_ia coincide when the angles of
the two revolute joints of the universal joint are zero) and by
parameter vector <b>rRod_ia</b>, the position vector from the
origin of frame_a to the origin of frame_b, resolved in
frame_<b>ia</b>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <b>reference configuration</b>
where <b>all frames</b> of all components are <b>parallel</b> to
other (alternatively, at least frame_a and frame_ia of the
UniversalSpherical joint should be parallel to other when defining
an instance of this component). Since frame_a and frame_ia are
parallel to other, vector <b>rRod_ia</b> from frame_a to frame_b
resolved in frame_<b>ia</b> can be resolved in frame_<b>a</b> (or
the <b>world frame</b>, if all frames are parallel to other).</p>
<p>This joint aggregation can be used in cases where in reality a
rod with spherical joints at end are present. Such a system has an
additional degree of freedom to rotate the rod along its axis. In
practice this rotation is usually of no interest and is
mathematically removed by replacing one of the spherical joints by
a universal joint. Still, in most cases the
Joints.SphericalSpherical joint aggregation can be used instead of
the UniversalSpherical joint since the rod is animated and its mass
properties are approximated by a point mass in the middle of the
rod. The SphericalSpherical joint has the advantage that it does
not have a singular configuration.</p>
<p>In the public interface of the UniversalSpherical joint, the
following (final) <b>parameters</b> are provided:</p>
<pre>
  <b>parameter</b> Real rodLength(unit="m")  "Length of rod";
  <b>parameter</b> Real eRod_ia[3] "Unit vector along rod, resolved in frame_ia";
  <b>parameter</b> Real e2_ia  [3] "Unit vector along axis 2, resolved in frame_ia";
</pre>
<p>This allows a more convenient definition of data which is
related to the rod. For example, if a box shall be connected at
frame_ia directing from the origin of frame_a to the middle of the
rod, this might be defined as:</p>
<pre>
    Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Joints.UniversalSpherical jointUS(rRod_ia={1.2, 1, 0.2});
    Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Visualizers.FixedShape    shape(shapeType       = "box",
                                              lengthDirection = jointUS.eRod_ia,
                                              widthDirection  = jointUS.e2_ia,
                                              length          = jointUS.rodLength/2,
                                              width           = jointUS.rodLength/10);
  <b>equation</b>
    <b>connect</b>(jointUS.frame_ia, shape.frame_a);
