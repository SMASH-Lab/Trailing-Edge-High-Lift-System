<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Pressure drop equations and other fluid characteristics are
usually computed by <b>semi-empirical</b> equations. Unfortunately,
the developers of semi-empirical equations nearly never take into
account that the equation might be used in a simulation program. As
a consequence, these semi-empirical equations can nearly never be
used blindly but must be slightly modified or adapted in order that
obvious simulation problems are avoided. Below, examples are given
to demonstrate what problems occur and how to regularize the
characteristics:</p>
<h4>Square root function</h4>
<p>In several empirical formulae, expressions of the following form
are present, e.g., for turbulent flow in a pipe:</p>
<pre>
   y = <b>if</b> x &lt; 0 <b>then</b> -<b>sqrt</b>( <b>abs</b>(x) ) <b>else</b> <b>sqrt</b>(x)
</pre>
<p>A plot of this characteristic is shown in the next figure:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Fluid/UsersGuide/sqrt.png" alt="sqrt.png" /></p>
<p>The difficulty with this function is that the derivative at x=0
is infinity. In reality, such a function does not exist. E.g., for
pipe flow, the flow becomes laminar for small velocities and
therefore around zero the sqrt() function is replaced by a linear
function. Since the laminar region is usually of not much practical
interest, the above approximation is used.</p>
<p>The direct implementation above does not work in Modelica,
because an event is generated when x &lt; 0 changes sign. In order
to detect this event, an event iteration takes place. During the
event iteration, the active if-branch is not changed. For example,
assume that x is positive (= "else" branch) and shall become
negative. During the event iteration x is slightly negative and the
else branch, i.e., sqrt(x), is evaluated. Since this results in an
imaginary number, an error occurs. It would be possible to fix
this, by using the <b>noEvent</b>() operator to explicitly switch
of an event:</p>
<pre>
   y = <b>if</b> <b>noEvent</b>(x &lt; 0) <b>then</b> -<b>sqrt</b>( <b>abs</b>(x) ) <b>else</b> <b>sqrt</b>(x)
</pre>
<p>Still, it is highly likely that good integrators will not work
well around x=0, because they will recognize that the derivative
changes very sharply and will reduce the step size drastically.</p>
<p>There are several solutions around this problem: Around x=0, the
sqrt() function can be replaced by a polynomial of 3rd order which
is determined in such a way that it smoothly touches the sqrt()
function, i.e., the whole function is continuous and continuously
differentiable. In the Modelica.Fluid library, implementations of
such critical functions are provided in sublibrary
Modelica.Fluid.Utilities. The above sqrt() type function is
computed by function <b>Utilities.regRoot</b>(). This function is
defined as:</p>
<pre>
     y := x/(x*x+delta*delta)^0.25;
</pre>
<p>where "delta" is the size of the small region around zero where
the sqrt() function is approximated by another function. The plot
of the function above is practically identical to the one of the
original function. However, it has a finite derivative at x=0 and
is differentiable up to any order. With the default value of
delta=0.01, the difference between the function above and
regRoot(x) is 16% around x=0.01, 0.25% around x=0.1 and 0.0025%
around x=1.</p>
