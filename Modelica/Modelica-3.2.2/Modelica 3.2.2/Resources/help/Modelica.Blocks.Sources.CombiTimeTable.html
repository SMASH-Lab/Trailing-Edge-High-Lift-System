<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This block generates an output signal y[:] by <b>linear
interpolation</b> in a table. The time points and function values
are stored in a matrix <b>table[i,j]</b>, where the first column
table[:,1] contains the time points and the other columns contain
the data to be interpolated.</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Blocks/Sources/CombiTimeTable.png" alt="CombiTimeTable.png" /></p>
<p>Via parameter <b>columns</b> it can be defined which columns of
the table are interpolated. If, e.g., columns={2,4}, it is assumed
that 2 output signals are present and that the first output is
computed by interpolation of column 2 and the second output is
computed by interpolation of column 4 of the table matrix. The
table interpolation has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time points need to be <b>strictly increasing</b> if
smoothness is ContinuousDerivative, otherwise <b>monotonically
increasing</b>.</li>
<li><b>Discontinuities</b> are allowed, by providing the same time
point twice in the table.</li>
<li>Values <b>outside</b> of the table range, are computed by
extrapolation according to the setting of parameter
<b>extrapolation</b>:
<pre>
  extrapolation = 1: hold the first or last value of the table,
                     if outside of the table scope.
                = 2: extrapolate by using the derivative at the first/last table
                     points if outside of the table scope.
                     (If smoothness is LinearSegments or ConstantSegments
                     this means to extrapolate linearly through the first/last
                     two table points.).
                = 3: periodically repeat the table data
                     (periodical function).
                = 4: no extrapolation, i.e. extrapolation triggers an error
</pre></li>
<li>Via parameter <b>smoothness</b> it is defined how the data is
interpolated:
<pre>
  smoothness = 1: linear interpolation
             = 2: Akima interpolation: Smooth interpolation by cubic Hermite
                  splines such that der(y) is continuous, also if extrapolated.
             = 3: constant segments
             = 4: Fritsch-Butland interpolation: Smooth interpolation by cubic
                  Hermite splines such that y preserves the monotonicity and
                  der(y) is continuous, also if extrapolated.
             = 5: Steffen interpolation: Smooth interpolation by cubic Hermite
                  splines such that y preserves the monotonicity and der(y)
                  is continuous, also if extrapolated.
</pre></li>
<li>If the table has only <b>one row</b>, no interpolation is
performed and the table values of this row are just returned.</li>
<li>Via parameters <b>startTime</b> and <b>offset</b> the curve
defined by the table can be shifted both in time and in the
ordinate value. The time instants stored in the table are therefore
<b>relative</b> to <b>startTime</b>. If time &lt; startTime, no
interpolation is performed and the offset is used as ordinate value
for all outputs.</li>
<li>The table is implemented in a numerically sound way by
generating <b>time events</b> at interval boundaries. An interval
boundary is defined by two identical time values following each
other. For example
<pre>
   table = [0, 0;
            1, 0;
            1, 1;
            2, 3;
            3, 5;
            3, 2;
            4, 4;
            5, 5];
</pre>
defines three intervalls: 0..1, 1..3, 3..5. Within an interval the
defined interpolation method is applied (so the table outputs
within an interval are continuous,and if the interpolation method
is smooth, also continuously differentiable). No time events are
generated within an interval in order that also intervals with many
points do not reduce the simulation efficiency (note in package
Modelica version 3.2 and earlier, time events had been
generated).<br />
If the table points are largely changing, it is adviseable to force
time events by duplicating every time point (especially, if the
model in which the table is present allows the variable step
integrator to make large integrator steps). For example, if a
sawtooth signal is defined with the table, it is more reliable to
define the table as:
<pre>
   table = [0, 0;
            1, 2;
            1, 2;
            2, 0;
            2, 0;
            3, 2;
            3, 2];
</pre>
instead of
<pre>
   table = [0, 0;
            1, 2;
            2, 0;
            3, 2];
</pre>
because time events are then generated at every time point.</li>
<li>Via parameter <b>timeScale</b> the first column of the table
array can be scaled, e.g. if the table array is given in hours
(instead of seconds) <b>timeScale</b> shall be set to 3600.</li>
<li>For special applications it is sometimes needed to know the
minimum and maximum time instant defined in the table as a
parameter. For this reason parameters
<b>t_min</b>/<b>t_minScaled</b> and <b>t_max</b>/<b>t_maxScaled</b>
are provided and can be accessed from the outside of the table
object. Whereas <b>t_min</b> and <b>t_max</b> define the scaled
abscissa values (using parameter <b>timeScale</b>) in SIunits.Time,
<b>t_minScaled</b> and <b>t_maxScaled</b> define the unitless
original abscissa values of the table.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
   table = [0, 0;
            1, 0;
            1, 1;
            2, 4;
            3, 9;
            4, 16]; extrapolation = 3 (default)
If, e.g., time = 1.0, the output y =  0.0 (before event), 1.0 (after event)
    e.g., time = 1.5, the output y =  2.5,
    e.g., time = 2.0, the output y =  4.0,
    e.g., time = 5.0, the output y = 23.0 (i.e., extrapolation via last 2 points).
</pre>
<p>The table matrix can be defined in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explicitly supplied as <b>parameter matrix</b> "table", and the
other parameters have the following values:
<pre>
   tableName is "NoName" or has only blanks,
   fileName  is "NoName" or has only blanks.
</pre></li>
<li><b>Read</b> from a <b>file</b> "fileName" where the matrix is
stored as "tableName". Both ASCII and MAT-file format is possible.
(The ASCII format is described below). The MAT-file format comes in
four different versions: v4, v6, v7 and v7.3. The library supports
at least v4, v6 and v7 whereas v7.3 is optional. It is most
convenient to generate the MAT-file from FreeMat or MATLABÂ® by
command
<pre>
   save tables.mat tab1 tab2 tab3
</pre>
or Scilab by command
<pre>
   savematfile tables.mat tab1 tab2 tab3
</pre>
when the three tables tab1, tab2, tab3 should be used from the
model.<br />
Note, a fileName can be defined as URI by using the helper function
<a href="Modelica.Utilities.Files.loadResource.html">loadResource</a>.</li>
<li>Statically stored in function "usertab" in file "usertab.c".
The matrix is identified by "tableName". Parameter fileName =
"NoName" or has only blanks. Row-wise storage is always to be
preferred as otherwise the table is reallocated and
transposed.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the constant "NO_FILE_SYSTEM" is defined, all file I/O
related parts of the source code are removed by the C-preprocessor,
such that no access to files takes place.</p>
<p>If tables are read from an ASCII-file, the file needs to have
the following structure ("-----" is not part of the file
content):</p>
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------
#1
double tab1(6,2)   # comment line
  0   0
  1   0
  1   1
  2   4
  3   9
  4  16
double tab2(6,2)   # another comment line
  0   0
  2   0
  2   2
  4   8
  6  18
  8  32
-----------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>Note, that the first two characters in the file need to be "#1"
(a line comment defining the version number of the file format).
Afterwards, the corresponding matrix has to be declared with type
(= "double" or "float"), name and actual dimensions. Finally, in
successive rows of the file, the elements of the matrix have to be
given. The elements have to be provided as a sequence of numbers in
row-wise order (therefore a matrix row can span several lines in
the file and need not start at the beginning of a line). Numbers
have to be given according to C syntax (such as 2.3, -2, +2.e4).
Number separators are spaces, tab (\t), comma (,), or semicolon
(;). Several matrices may be defined one after another. Line
comments start with the hash symbol (#) and can appear everywhere.
Other characters, like trailing non comments, are not allowed in
the file.</p>
