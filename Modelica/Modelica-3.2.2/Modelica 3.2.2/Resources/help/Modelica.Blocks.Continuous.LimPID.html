<p>Via parameter <b>controllerType</b> either <b>P</b>, <b>PI</b>,
<b>PD</b>, or <b>PID</b> can be selected. If, e.g., PI is selected,
all components belonging to the D-part are removed from the block
(via conditional declarations). The example model <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Examples.PID_Controller.html">Modelica.Blocks.Examples.PID_Controller</a>
demonstrates the usage of this controller. Several practical
aspects of PID controller design are incorporated according to
chapter 3 of the book:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Åström K.J., and Hägglund T.:</dt>
<dd><b>PID Controllers: Theory, Design, and Tuning</b>. Instrument
Society of America, 2nd edition, 1995.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Besides the additive <b>proportional, integral</b> and
<b>derivative</b> part of this controller, the following features
are present:</p>
<ul>
<li>The output of this controller is limited. If the controller is
in its limits, anti-windup compensation is activated to drive the
integrator state to zero.</li>
<li>The high-frequency gain of the derivative part is limited to
avoid excessive amplification of measurement noise.</li>
<li>Setpoint weighting is present, which allows to weight the
setpoint in the proportional and the derivative part independently
from the measurement. The controller will respond to load
disturbances and measurement noise independently of this setting
(parameters wp, wd). However, setpoint changes will depend on this
setting. For example, it is useful to set the setpoint weight wd
for the derivative part to zero, if steps may occur in the setpoint
signal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The parameters of the controller can be manually adjusted by
performing simulations of the closed loop system (= controller +
plant connected together) and using the following strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set very large limits, e.g., yMax = Modelica.Constants.inf</li>
<li>Select a <b>P</b>-controller and manually enlarge parameter
<b>k</b> (the total gain of the controller) until the closed-loop
response cannot be improved any more.</li>
<li>Select a <b>PI</b>-controller and manually adjust parameters
<b>k</b> and <b>Ti</b> (the time constant of the integrator). The
first value of Ti can be selected, such that it is in the order of
the time constant of the oscillations occurring with the
P-controller. If, e.g., vibrations in the order of T=10 ms occur in
the previous step, start with Ti=0.01 s.</li>
<li>If you want to make the reaction of the control loop faster
(but probably less robust against disturbances and measurement
noise) select a <b>PID</b>-Controller and manually adjust
parameters <b>k</b>, <b>Ti</b>, <b>Td</b> (time constant of
derivative block).</li>
<li>Set the limits yMax and yMin according to your
specification.</li>
<li>Perform simulations such that the output of the PID controller
goes in its limits. Tune <b>Ni</b> (Ni*Ti is the time constant of
the anti-windup compensation) such that the input to the limiter
block (= limiter.u) goes quickly enough back to its limits. If Ni
is decreased, this happens faster. If Ni=infinity, the anti-windup
compensation is switched off and the controller works bad.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Initialization</b></p>
<p>This block can be initialized in different ways controlled by
parameter <b>initType</b>. The possible values of initType are
defined in <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Types.InitPID.html">Modelica.Blocks.Types.InitPID</a>.
This type is identical to <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Types.Init.html">Types.Init</a>, with the
only exception that the additional option
<b>DoNotUse_InitialIntegratorState</b> is added for backward
compatibility reasons (= integrator is initialized with
InitialState whereas differential part is initialized with NoInit
which was the initialization in version 2.2 of the Modelica
standard library).</p>
<p>Based on the setting of initType, the integrator (I) and
derivative (D) blocks inside the PID controller are initialized
according to the following table:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>initType</b></td>
<td valign="top"><b>I.initType</b></td>
<td valign="top"><b>D.initType</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>NoInit</b></td>
<td valign="top">NoInit</td>
<td valign="top">NoInit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>SteadyState</b></td>
<td valign="top">SteadyState</td>
<td valign="top">SteadyState</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>InitialState</b></td>
<td valign="top">InitialState</td>
<td valign="top">InitialState</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>InitialOutput</b><br />
and initial equation: y = y_start</td>
<td valign="top">NoInit</td>
<td valign="top">SteadyState</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>DoNotUse_InitialIntegratorState</b></td>
<td valign="top">InitialState</td>
<td valign="top">NoInit</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In many cases, the most useful initial condition is
<b>SteadyState</b> because initial transients are then no longer
present. If initType = InitPID.SteadyState, then in some cases
difficulties might occur. The reason is the equation of the
integrator:</p>
<pre>
   <b>der</b>(y) = k*u;
</pre>
<p>The steady state equation "der(x)=0" leads to the condition that
the input u to the integrator is zero. If the input u is already
(directly or indirectly) defined by another initial condition, then
the initialization problem is <b>singular</b> (has none or
infinitely many solutions). This situation occurs often for
mechanical systems, where, e.g., u = desiredSpeed - measuredSpeed
and since speed is both a state and a derivative, it is natural to
initialize it with zero. As sketched this is, however, not
possible. The solution is to not initialize u_m or the variable
that is used to compute u_m by an algebraic equation.</p>
<p>If parameter <b>limitAtInit</b> = <b>false</b>, the limits at
the output of this controller block are removed from the
initialization problem which leads to a much simpler equation
system. After initialization has been performed, it is checked via
an assert whether the output is in the defined limits. For backward
compatibility reasons <b>limitAtInit</b> = <b>true</b>. In most
cases it is best to use <b>limitAtInit</b> = <b>false</b>.</p>
