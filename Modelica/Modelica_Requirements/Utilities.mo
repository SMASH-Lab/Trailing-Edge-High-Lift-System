<h4>Syntax</h4>

<blockquote><p>
(distance, polygonPoint) = <b>minimumDistanceToPolygon</b>(polygon, point);
</p></blockquote>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
This function computes the minimum distance of a point to a polygon.
</p>

<p>
The polygon is defined by a set of points <b>polygon</b>[:,2],
where polygon[i,1] is the x-coordinate of
polygon point i and polygon[i,2] is the y-coordinate. The last point of the polygon
can be identical to the first point, so polygon[1,:] = polygon[end,:].
If this is not the case, the function assumes that the last point
polygon[end,:] is connected implicitely to the first point polygon[1,:].
</p>

<p>
The goal is to compute the minimum distance of the vector input <b>point</b> 
to polygon, where point[1] is the x-coordinate and point[2] the y-coordinate.
</p>

<p>
The function returns the minimum distance as <b>distance</b>. <br>
If distance &gt; 0, then point is inside of the polygon.<br>
If distance &lt; 0, then point is outside of the polygon.<br>
If distance = 0, then point is on the polygon.<br>
Furthermore, the point polygonPoint[2] is returned, which is a point
on polygon (either on an edge or a vertex of the polygon) 
that is closest to input argument point.
