<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>There is a much improved library available called
"Modelica_StateGraph2". If this library is not yet distributed with
your Modelica tool, you can download it from <a href="https://www.modelica.org/libraries/Modelica_StateGraph2">https://www.modelica.org/libraries/Modelica_StateGraph2</a>.
Find below a comparison with respect to Modelica.StateGraph. It is
not yet clear whether Modelica_StateGraph2 will be included in a
future version of the Modelica package. Another option is to
provide built-in support for state machines in a future Modelica
language version which would allow an even more powerful treatment
of state machines in Modelica.</p>
<p>The Modelica_StateGraph2 library (called <u>StateGraph2</u>
below) is based on the experience with the current
Modelica.StateGraph library (called <u>StateGraph1</u> below) and
is a significantly further development of StateGraph1. Furthermore,
it is heavily based on the article (Malmheden et. al. 2008), see
Literature below, but uses a different implementation technique as
described in this article. The StateGraph2 library has the
following improvements with respect to the StateGraph1 library:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>3 Basic Components (Step, Transition, Parallel)</b><br />
All multiple versions of a component are combined in only one
version (e.g., one step and not 4 step components). This is easier
to understand and more convenient to use. The "Parallel" component
is both used as "composite step" (so only one branch), as well as
"parallel step" (so several execution branches).<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Conveniently connecting components</b><br />
Connecting components of a state machine in Modelica means to
provide new vector dimensions and to provide a vector index to
connect to. In StateGraph2, the new "connectorSizing" annotation is
used and therefore all this is now performed automatically (from a
users point of view, these actions are hidden; this is not the case
in StateGraph1 and makes the usage of the StateGraph1 library
clumsy).<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Safer state machines</b><br />
It is no longer possible to construct a wrong state machine in the
sense that properties of the graph are violated (e.g., two initial
steps, or branching wrongly out of a parallel component). Contrary
to StateGraph2, in StateGraph1 such wrong graphs do not lead to an
error but to unexpected simulation results. Still, other desirable
properties of a state machine, such as "no deadlock" or
"lifeliness" or "every step reachable", are not (yet) guaranteed
with the current StateGraph2.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Composite, autonomous, synchronized, preempted
subgraphs</b><br />
Composite steps and parallel steps are described in a much better
and more powerful way as in StateGraph1: Either by component
"Parallel" or by inheriting from "PartialParallel". The first
alternative has the advantage that it is simple to use (not
necessary to construct a new class and instantiating this class,
and easy variable access since no new hierarchy is constructed),
the second alternative has the advantage that it introduces a
Modelica hierarchy (useful for large subgraphs). In both cases,
various options are possible, such as
<ol>
<li>autonomous subgraphs (branches are executed in parallel
autonomously),</li>
<li>synchronized subgraphs (branches are executed in parallel and
are synchronized before leaving the subgraph via the outPort),</li>
<li>subgraphs with preemption and exception (a parallel step can be
interrupted via the suspend ports and can continue execution via
the resume ports).</li>
</ol>
This is achieved by enabling/disabling the different ports.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>No infinite looping</b>:<br />
As in StateGraph1, there are two types of transitions: immediate
transitions (during event iteration all immediate transitions fire
until no transition condition is true anymore) and delayed
transitions (a transition fires only after a delay). Contrary to
StateGraph1, in StateGraph2 every loop must have at least one
delayed transition. If this is not the case a translation error
occurs which states that the model contains an algebraic loop
between Booleans with the name
"checkOneDelayedTransitionPerLoop".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This property guarantees that an
event iteration over a StateGraph2 converges after a finite number
of iterations, provided the modeller does not introduce an unsafe
construct in the actions associated with a StateGraph2 (e.g., "i =
pre(i) + 1" in the equation section outside of a when-clause will
give an event iteration that never stops).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to switch off this
feature, by setting parameter "loopCheck = <b>false</b>" in one
transition of a loop, instead of using a "delayed transition" at
this place (in cases where immediate transitions are important and
the transition conditions are in a form that they cannot fire at
the same time instant).</li>
</ul>
