<p>THIS COMPONENT IS <b>OBSOLETE</b> and should <b>no longer be
used</b>. It is only kept for <b>backward compatibility</b>
purposes. Use model Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.LossyGear instead
which implements gear efficiency in a much more reliable way.</p>
<p>This component consists of two rigidly connected flanges
flange_a and flange_b without inertia where an <b>efficiency</b>
coefficient <b>eta</b> reduces the driven torque as function of the
driving torque depending on the direction of the energy flow, i.e.,
energy is always lost. This can be seen as a simple model of the
Coulomb friction acting between the teeth of a gearbox.</p>
<p>Note, that most gearbox manufacturers provide tables of the
efficiency of a gearbox as function of the angular velocity
(efficiency becomes zero, if the angular velocity is zero).
However, such a table is practically useless for simulation
purposes, because in gearboxes always two types of friction is
present: (1) Friction in the <b>bearings</b> and (2) friction
between the teeth of the gear. (1) leads to a velocity dependent,
additive loss-torque, whereas (2) leads to a torque-dependent
reduction of the driving torque. The gearbox manufacturers measure
both effects together and determine the gear efficiency from it,
although for simulation purposes the two effects need to be
separated. Assume for example that only constant bearing friction,
i.e., bearingTorque=const., is present, i.e.,</p>
<pre>
   (1)  loadTorque = motorTorque - sign(w)*bearingTorque
</pre>
<p>Gearbox manufacturers use the loss-formula</p>
<pre>
   (2)  loadTorque = eta*motorTorque
</pre>
<p>Comparing (1) and (2) gives a formula for the efficiency
eta:</p>
<pre>
   eta = (1 - sign(w)*bearingTorque/motorTorque)
</pre>
<p>When the motorTorque becomes smaller as the bearingTorque, (2)
is useless, because the efficiency is zero. To summarize, be
careful to determine the gear <b>efficiency</b> of this element
from tables of the gear manufacturers.</p>
