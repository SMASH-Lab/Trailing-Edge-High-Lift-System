<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Line force elements, such as a <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Forces.Spring.html">Spring</a>,
are usually connected between two parts. In fact, this is the only
possibility in most multi-body programs. In an equation based
system like Modelica, more general connections are possible. In
particular <b>3-dimensional line force</b> elements can be
connected together in <b>series</b> without having a body with mass
at the connection point. This is advantageous since stiff systems
can be avoided, say, due to a stiff spring and a small mass at the
connection point. For an example, see model <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Examples.Elementary.ThreeSprings.html">
ThreeSprings</a>:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/Examples/Elementary/ThreeSprings.png" /></p>
<p>Here, three springs are connected together at one point, without
having a body at the connection point of the springs. There is one
difficulty: In such a situation the orientation object at the
connection point is undefined, because the springs do not transmit
torques. Translation will therefore fail, if three springs and a
body are connected together in this way. To handle such a case, all
line force elements have flags "fixedRotationAtFrame_a" and
"fixedRotationAtFrame_b" in their "Advanced" parameter menu. For
example, if "fixedRotationAtFrame_b = <b>true</b>", the orientation
object at frame_b is explicitly set to a null rotation, i.e.,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
frame_b.R = Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Frames.nullRotation();
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This means that the coordinate system in the connection point of
the three springs is always parallel to the world frame. When this
option is selected, the corresponding frame in the line force icon
is marked with a red circle and with the text "R=0". This is shown
in the next figure, where this option is selected for
spring3.frame_b:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/ThreeSpringsDiagramLayer.png" /></p>
<p>Note, if this flag is not set to <b>true</b>, a translation
error will occur. Due to the usage of overdetermined connectors in
the MultiBody library, the error message will be something like:
.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The overdetermined connectors &lt;...&gt; are connected but do
not have any root defined"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two flags "fixedRotationAtFrame_a" and
"fixedRotationAtFrame_b must be very carefully set, because a wrong
definition can lead to a model that simulates, but the simulation
result is wrong. This is the case, whenever the movement of the
resulting system depends on the orientation object that was
arbitrarily set in parallel to the world frame. A typical example
is shown in the next figure:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Mechanics/MultiBody/UsersGuide/ThreeSprings2DiagramLayer.png" /></p>
<p>Here, spring3.frame_b.R is defined to be in parallel to the
world frame. However, this is then also the orientation of
fixedTranslation.frame_a, and this in turn means that the left part
of the fixedTranslation object is always in parallel to the world
frame. Since this is not correct, this model will result in a
<b>wrong simulation result</b> This system is mathematically not
well-defined and does not have a solution. The only way to model
such a system is by providing a mass and an inertia tensor to
fixedTranslation. Then, the flags are not needed, because the
"connection" point of the springs is a body where the absolution
position vector and the orientation matrix of the body-fixed
coordinate system are used as states.</p>
