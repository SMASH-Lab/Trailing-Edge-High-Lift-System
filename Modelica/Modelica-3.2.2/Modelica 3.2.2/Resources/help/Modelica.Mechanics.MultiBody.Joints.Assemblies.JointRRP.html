<p>This component consists of <b>2 revolute</b> joints with
parallel axes of rotation that and a <b>prismatic</b> joint with a
translational axis that is orthogonal to the revolute joint axes,
see the default animation in the following figure (the axes vectors
are not part of the default animation):</p>

<p>This joint aggregation introduces neither constraints nor state
variables and should therefore be used in kinematic loops whenever
possible to avoid non-linear systems of equations. It is only
meaningful to use this component in <b>planar loops</b>. Basically,
the position and orientation of the 3 joints as well as of
frame_ia, frame_ib, and frame_im are calculated by solving
analytically a non-linear equation, given the position and
orientation at frame_a and at frame_b.</p>
<p>Connector <b>frame_a</b> is the "left" side of the first
revolute joint whereas <b>frame_ia</b> is the "right side of this
revolute joint, fixed in rod 1. Connector <b>frame_b</b> is the
"right" side of the prismatic joint whereas <b>frame_ib</b> is the
"left" side of this prismatic joint, fixed in rod 2. Finally,
connector <b>frame_im</b> is the connector at the "right" side of
the revolute joint in the middle, fixed in rod 2. The frames
frame_b, frame_ib, frame_im are always parallel to each other.</p>
<p>The easiest way to define the parameters of this joint is by
moving the MultiBody system in a <b>reference configuration</b>
where <b>all frames</b> of all components are <b>parallel</b> to
each other (alternatively, at least frame_a, frame_ia, frame_im,
frame_ib, frame_b of the JointRRP joint should be parallel to each
other when defining an instance of this component).</p>
<p>Basically, the JointRRP model consists internally of a universal
- spherical - prismatic joint aggregation (= JointUSP). In a planar
loop this will behave as if 2 revolute joints with parallel axes
and 1 prismatic joint are connected by rigid rods.</p>
