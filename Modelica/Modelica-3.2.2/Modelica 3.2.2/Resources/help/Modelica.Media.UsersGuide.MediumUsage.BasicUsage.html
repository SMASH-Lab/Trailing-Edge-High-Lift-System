<h4>Basic usage of medium model</h4>
<p>Media models in Modelica.Media are provided by packages,
inheriting from the partial package
Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium. Every package defines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medium <b>constants</b> (such as the number of chemical
substances, molecular data, critical properties, etc.).</li>
<li>A BaseProperties <b>model</b>, to compute the basic
thermodynamic properties of the fluid;</li>
<li><b>setState_XXX</b> functions to compute the thermodynamic
state record from different input arguments (such as density,
temperature, and composition which would be setState_dTX);</li>
<li><b>Functions</b> to compute additional properties (such as
saturation properties, viscosity, thermal conductivity, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are - as stated above - two different basic ways of using
the Media library which will be described in more details in the
following section. One way is to use the model BaseProperties.
Every instance of BaseProperties for any medium model provides
<b>3+nXi equations</b> for the following <b>5+nXi variables</b>
that are declared in the medium model (nXi is the number of
independent mass fractions, see explanation below):</p>

BaseProperties by:<br />
X = <b>if</b> reducedX <b>then</b> vector([Xi; 1-<b>sum</b>(Xi)])
<b>else</b> Xi</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><b>Two</b> variables out of p, d, h, or u, as well as the
<b>mass fractions</b> Xi are the <b>independent</b> variables and
the medium model basically provides equations to compute the
remaining variables, including the full mass fraction vector X
(more details to Xi and X are given further below).</p>
<p>In a component, the most basic usage of a medium model is as
follows</p>
<pre>
  <b>model</b> Pump
    <b>replaceable package</b> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                         "Medium model" <b>annotation</b> (choicesAllMatching = <b>true</b>);
    Medium.BaseProperties medium_a "Medium properties at location a (e.g., port_a)";
    // Use medium variables (medium_a.p, medium_a.T, medium_a.h, ...)
     ...
  <b>end</b> Pump;
</pre>
<p>The second way is to use the setState_XXX functions to compute
the thermodynamic state record from which all other thermodynamic
state variables can be computed (see <a href="Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition.BasicDefinition.html">
Basic definition of medium</a> for further details on
ThermodynamicState). The setState_XXX functions accept either X or
Xi (see explanation below) and will decide internally which of
these two compositions is provided by the user. The four
fundamental setState_XXX functions are provided in
PartialMedium</p>

<td valign="top"><b>Function</b></td>
<td valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
<td valign="top"><b>Short-form for<br />

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">setState_pTX</td>
<td valign="top">computes ThermodynamicState from pressure,

<td valign="top">setState_pT</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The simple example that explained the basic usage of
BaseProperties would then become</p>
<pre>
  <b>model</b> Pump
    <b>replaceable package</b> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                         "Medium model" <b>annotation</b> (choicesAllMatching = <b>true</b>);
    Medium.ThermodynamicState state_a "Thermodynamic state record at location a (e.g., port_a)";
    // Compute medium variables from thermodynamic state record (pressure(state_a), temperature(state_a),
    // specificEnthalpy(state_a), ...)
    ...
  <b>end</b> Pump;
</pre>
<p>All media models are directly or indirectly a subpackage of
package Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium. Therefore, a
medium model in a component should inherit from this partial
package. Via the annotation "choicesAllMatching = true" it is
defined that the tool should display a selection box with all
loaded packages that inherit from PartialMedium. An example is
given in the next figure:</p>
<p><img src="../../../Modelica%203.2.2/Resources/Images/Media/UsersGuide/mediumMenu.png" alt="medium selection menu" /></p>
<p>A selected medium model leads, e.g., to the following
equation:</p>
<pre>
  Pump pump(<b>redeclare package</b> Medium = Modelica.Media.Water.SimpleLiquidWater);
</pre>
<p>Usually, a medium model is associated with the variables of a
fluid connector. Therefore, equations have to be defined in a model
that relate the variables in the connector with the variables in
the medium model:</p>
<pre>
  <b>model</b> Pump
    <b>replaceable package</b> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                         "Medium model" <b>annotation</b> (choicesAllMatching = <b>true</b>);
    Medium.BaseProperties medium_a "Medium properties of port_a";
    // definition of the fluid port port_a
     ...
  <b>equation</b>
    medium.p = port_a.p;
    medium.h = port_a.h;
    medium.Xi = port_a.Xi;
     ...
  <b>end</b> Pump;
</pre>
in the case of using BaseProperties or
<pre>
  <b>model</b> Pump
    <b>replaceable package</b> Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                         "Medium model" <b>annotation</b> (choicesAllMatching = <b>true</b>);
    Medium.ThermodynamicState state_a "Thermodynamic state record of medium at port_a";
    // definition of the fluid port port_a
     ...
  <b>equation</b>
    state_a = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p, port_a.h, port_a.Xi) // if port_a contains the variables
                                                                 // p, h, and Xi
     ...
  <b>end</b> Pump;
</pre>
<p>in the case of using ThermodynamicState.</p>
<p>If a component model shall treat both single and multiple
substance fluids, equations for the mass fractions have to be
present (above: medium.Xi = port_a.Xi) in the model. According to
the Modelica semantics, the equations of the mass fractions are
ignored, if the dimension of Xi is zero, i.e., for a
single-component medium. Note, by specific techniques sketched in
section "Medium definition", the independent variables in the
medium model need not to be the same as the variables in the
connector and still get the same efficiency, as if the same
variables would be used.</p>
<p>If a fluid consists of a single substance, <b>nXi = 0</b> and
the vector of mass fractions Xi is not present. If a fluid consists
of nS substances, the medium model may define the number of
independent mass fractions <b>nXi</b> to be <b>nS</b>, <b>nS-1</b>,
or zero. In all cases, balance equations for nXi substances have to
be given in the corresponding component (see discussion below).
Note, that if nXi = nS, the constraint "sum(Xi)=1" between the mass
fractions is <b>not</b> present in the model; in that case, it is
necessary to provide consistent start values for Xi such that
sum(Xi) = 1.</p>
<p>The reason for this definition of Xi is that a fluid component
library can be implemented by using only the independent mass
fractions Xi and then via the medium it is defined how Xi is
interpreted:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Xi = nS, then the constraint equation sum(X) = 1 is
neglected during simulation. By making sure that the initial
conditions of X fulfill this constraint, it can usually be
guaranteed that small errors in sum(X) = 1 remain small although
this constraint equation is not explicitly used during the
simulation. This approach is usually useful if components of the
mixture can become very small. If such a small quantity is computed
via the equation 1 - sum(X[1:nX-1]), there might be large numerical
errors and it is better to compute it via the corresponding balance
equation.</li>
<li>If Xi = nS-1, then the true independent mass fractions are used
in the fluid component and the last component of X is computed via
X[nX] = 1 - sum(Xi). This is useful for, e.g., MoistAir, where the
number of states should be as small as possible without introducing
numerical problems.</li>
<li>If Xi = 0, then the reference value of composition reference_X
is assumed. This case is useful to avoid composition states in all
the cases when the composition will always be constant, e.g., with
circuits having fixed composition sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full vector of mass fractions <b>X[nX]</b> is computed in
PartialMedium.BaseProperties based on Xi, reference_X, and the
information whether Xi = nS or nS-1. For single-substance media, nX
= 0, so there's also no X vector. For multiple-substance media, nX
= nS, and X always contains the full vector of mass fractions. In
order to reduce confusion for the user of a fluid component
library, "Xi" has the annotation "HideResult=true", meaning, that
this variable is not shown in the plot window. Only X is shown in
the plot window and this vector always contains all mass
fractions.</p>
