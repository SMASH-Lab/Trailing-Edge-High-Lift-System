<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Joint with <b>3 constraints</b> that define that the origin of
frame_a and the origin of frame_b coincide. By default this joint
defines only the 3 constraints without any potential states. If
parameter <b>enforceStates</b> is set to <b>true</b> in the
"Advanced" menu, three states are introduced. Depending on
parameter <b>useQuaternions</b> these are either quaternions and
the relative angular velocity or 3 angles and the angle
derivatives. In the latter case the orientation of frame_b is
computed by rotating frame_a along the axes defined in parameter
vector "sequence_angleStates" (default = {1,2,3}, i.e., the Cardan
angle sequence) around the angles used as states. For example, the
default is to rotate the x-axis of frame_a around angles[1], the
new y-axis around angles[2] and the new z-axis around angles[3],
arriving at frame_b. If angles are used as states there is the
slight disadvantage that a singular configuration is present
leading to a division by zero.</p>
<p>If this joint is used in a <b>chain</b> structure, a Modelica
translator has to select orientation coordinates of a body as
states, if the default setting is used. It is usually better to use
relative coordinates in the spherical joint as states, and
therefore in this situation parameter enforceStates might be set to
<b>true</b>.</p>
<p>If this joint is used in a <b>loop</b> structure, the default
setting results in a <b>cut-joint</b> that breaks the loop in
independent kinematic pieces, hold together by the constraints of
this joint. As a result, a Modelica translator will first try to
select 3 generalized coordinates in the joints of the remaining
parts of the loop and their first derivative as states and if this
is not possible, e.g., because there are only spherical joints in
the loop, will select coordinates from a body of the loop as
states.</p>
<p>In the following figure the animation of a spherical joint is
shown. The light blue coordinate system is frame_a and the dark
blue coordinate system is frame_b of the joint. (here: angles_start
= {45, 45, 45}<sup>o</sup>).</p>
